The first objection taken by the defendant s counsel in this case is that where a man of any age has signed the enlistment, taken the oath, and been mustered in, no judge has a right to interfere by habeas corpus to discharge him until the war department has improperly refused. The constitution of the United States (article 1,   9) declares    that the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus shall not be suspended unless when in eases of rebellion or invasion the public safety may require it.  Congress could not pass a law vesting the war department with a power which would in effect suspend the writ of habeas corpus. The judges, by law. are vested with the power to issue writs of habeas corpus in all cases where citizens are illegally confined. Men constrained to enlist by force, or enlisted under the age of twenty-one, without the consent of their parents, masters, or guardians, are illegally confined. They are not regularly soldiers, not having been properly and legally enlisted, and are therefore entitled to their discharge upon a writ of habeas corpus. In this case the proof is clear that the son is under the age of twenty-one years. It is next insisted that the habeas corpus issued improperly, the application having been made by the father and not the son, and that, therefore, the writ should be quashed. To support 'this idea the defendant s counsel have cited G Term R. 497  7 Term R. 745  Cowp. G72. In the first case cited the apprentice was twenty-two years of age. The court, in giving their opinion, founded it not only on the apprentice being of sufficient age to judge for himself, but also because he was over the age of eighteen, under which, by the statute of Anne, apprentices could not be impressed. The plain inference is that if he had been under the age of eighteen the impressment would have been illegal, and the apprentice would have been restored to his master upon a writ of habeas corpus. The ease in 7 Term R. 745. is expressly decided on the authority of the first case. It is not stated what was the age of the apprentice, but as the court refer to the former case, it is fair to suppose he was over the age of eighteen. The case in Cowp. 072, is a writ of habeas corpus directed to the commanding officer of a man-of-war. on board of which the two persons intended to be brought up were acting in the capacity of common sailors, but not as prisoners. The court said that if the men were served with subpoenas they might have been willing to attend, and that they could not be brought up as prisoners without their consent. The court cannot conceive that the case has any analogy to the one now before it. except in the general words used by the court  that they can never be brought up as prisoners against their consent.  The court surely never intended this expression to extend to the cases of idiots, femme coverts, minors under the age of discretion, or even to minors under the age of twenty-one who are confined expressly against law. On the other side, the counsel in support of the habeas corpus have cited 1 Burrows, 339  1 Strange, 579  2 Strange, 982  2 Burrows, 1334  1 Strange, 641  1 Burrows, 542.606  2 Burrows, 1115  1 Burrows 687  3 Burrows, 1434  3 Bac. Abr. 5, 6,15. Without referring particularly to those cases it may be remarked that they go to show a writ of habeas corpus may issue at the instance of persons other than the one confined. A husband is entitled to this writ in favor of his wife, a guardian in favor of his ward, and, of course, a father for his infant son. It seems to be granted that the writ may issue at the instance of the father in favor of an infant of tender years, viz., under the age of fourteen  but that, after that age, the child is deemed by law to have discretion enough to apply for a habeas corpus if one is necessary. This presents to the court the principal difficulty, if any exists. But in none of the cases produced does it appear that the person detained was enlisted against an express statute requiring the consent, in writing, of the parent, master, or guardian, previous to the enlistment  and from the strictest examination I have been able to give these cases I feel confident that, had the impressments been made directly against a positive law which required the cooperation of the parent, master, or guardian to make the impressment legal, the writ of habeas corpus might have issued at the instance of persons acting in either of those capacities as the case might happen to be. In the case before me the illegality entirely consists in the want of consent of the parent in writing, and it is obvious that congress did not intend the minor should have any discretion, either as to enlistment or discharge.

Army   Enlistment of Minor   Habeas Corpus. The enlistment in the army of a minor without the consent of his parent is a ground for discharge, on habeas corpus, at the instance of the parent. This was a writ of habeas corpus, directed to Colonel Anderson, requiring him to bring up the body of Zebedee Bigby, alleged to be in his regiment and under his command. The application for the habeas corpus was made by George Bigby, the father, in a petition setting forth that the said Zebedee was under the age of twenty-one years, and had been enlisted without the consent of the father, master. or guardian The facts set forth in the petition were well supported by affidavits. Upon the investigation of this case two questions arose:. First, whether this court had a right to discharge the soldier until an application had been fruitlessly made to the secretary of war .' And secondly, whether he could be discharged, as- the application was not made, by him but by his father? The son was about eighteen years of age, and there was no proof that he wished to leave the service of the United States. NOTE. Federal courts have jurisdiction on habeas corpus to inquire into a contract of en-   listment, and to discharge minors enlisted in the army unlawfully or without consent of parents, without any application being first made to any other department of the government.

A person under age enlisted contrary to the Act of Congress is illegally confined, and must be discharged on habeas corpus, at the relation of his father, whether the enlisted party desires it or not, and without any previous application to the War Department. This was a writ of habeas corpus, directed to Colonel Anderson, requiring him to bring up the body of Zebedee Bigby, alleged to be in his regiment and under his command. The application for the habeas corpus was made by George Bigby, the father, in a petition setting forth that the said Zebedee was under the age of twenty-one years, and had been enlisted without the consent of the father, master, or guardian. The facts set forth in the petition were well supported by affidavits.

      "judges:   parties:  UNITED STATES v. STEWART. opinions:  In connexion with the case, Judge HOPKINSON prepared the following summary of cases, on the question of the enlistment of a minor in the navy: The question came before the circuit court of the United States for the First circuit, in 1816. U. S. v. Bainbridge [Case No. 14,497], One Robert Treadwell, an infant of the age of twenty years and about eleven months, born on the 2d August, 1795, enlisted in the navy, to serve two years, in May, 1815. He had deserted, was brought to-trial before a court martial, in June, 1815, and was sentenced to serve in the navy for two years from the 19th June, and to forfeit the wages then due him. He had a father living, then absent at sea, and it appeared that the enlistment had been without the father s consent It was contended for him: (1) That congress had no power to pass an act authorizing the enlistment of minors without the consent of their father  (2) that congress had passed no act authorizing such enlistment  (3) that it was not a contract for the benefit of the infant. The other side took these grounds: (1) That the contract, as made by the minor, was a valid one  (2) that if he might, at any time, have avoided it, he could not do so after he had been legally sentenced by a court martial  (3) that the acts of congress, for enlistments in the navy, make continual and particular mention of  boys,  who are required by the nature of the service. Story, Circuit Justice, delivered the opinion of the court He stated the .first question to be, whether the contract of enlistment, supposing it to have been made without the consent of the father, was void or not. By the common law, the father has a right to the custody of his children during their infancy. He is also entitled to the benefit of their labor, while they live with him, and are maintained by him. These rights, however, depend upon the mere municipal rules of the state, and may be enlarged, restrained, or limited, as the wisdom or policy of the times may dictate, unless the legislative power be controlled by some constitutional prohibition. The constitution of the United States gives-congress the power  to raise and support armies,  and  to provide and maintain a navy,  and  to make all laws which shall be necessary and proper  to execute these powers. The services of minors may be useful and important to the country, both in the army and navy. In the navy  the employment of minors is almost indispensable. Congress, therefore, have the power to enlist minors in the naval service, and the exercise of the power is justified by the soundest principles of national policy. They need not require the consent of the parents  such an assertion is extraordinary  it assumes that the legislative power cannot be exercised in derogation of the common law. Minors are enrolled in the militia, to perform military duty  and in the British navy minors are not only enlisted without the consent of their parents, but employed against their own consent. Do the laws of the United States authorize the enlistment of minors into the navy? All the acts, authorize the employment of midshipmen, who are invariably minors. All the acts since June, 1798, authorize the president to engage  boys,  in the ordinary duties of the navy. In no one of the laws is the consent of the parents or guardians required. The laws manifestly contemplate that it is a personal contract made by the infants themselves, for their own benefit. They are entitled to the pay, bounty, and prize-money. As to the case of a voidable contract made by an infant, at common law, it is meant that the  contract is voidable by the infant, at his own election, and not by the assent or dissent of the parents. The acts of congress could not intend to authorize an infant to enlist in the navy, and yet to avoid the contract at his election.  Upon the whole, as congress have authorized  boys  to be engaged in the service of the navy, without requiring the previous consent of their parents to the contract of enlistment, that contract, when fairly made with an infant of reasonable discretion, must be deemed to have a semblance of benefit to him, and to be essential to the public welfare, and, therefore, binding to all intents and purposes.  The acts respecting enlistments in the army provided  that no person, under the age of twenty-one years, shall be enlisted by any officer, or held in the service of the United States, without the consent of his parents, guardian, or master, first had and obtained, if any he have.  Afterwards, in January, 1813, the enlistment of minors, over eighteen years of age, was expressly authorized  and the proviso which required the consent of the parents, &c., repealed in December, 1814. Story s Laws, 1285, 1433 [2 Stat 791  3 Stat. 146]. The case of Emanuel Roberts, 2 Hall, Law J. 192, before Nicholson, C. J., Baltimore county, 1809: The constitution gives to congress the power of raising and maintaining a navy  the petitioner enlisted in the service of the United States  it is, therefore, a proceeding under the authority of the United States. It is alleged that the party is only sixteen years of age, and was drunk when he enlisted. The court recognises the contract of enlistment as a contract or agreement in which the United States was one party, and the petitioner the other. In the extreme case of a child eight or ten years of age, the court would discharge him, because of his incapacity to make a contract  not an incapacity arising from the general principle that he who has not attained the age of twenty-one years is incapable of binding himself, but from an actual imbecility of mind, owing to his tender years. The petitioner is not of this description. If he be only sixteen years of age, he is remarkably well grown.  Although it is a general rule that a person under twenty-one years of age cannot bind himself by contract, yet I am far from saying that this rule will apply in its unlimited extent, to prevent young men from enlisting in the service of their country, or to authorize their discharge upon an application to the courts of the United States.  He was of opinion that the court had no right to interfere in the case. Com. v. Gamble, 11 Serg. & R. 93, before the supreme court of Pennsylvania, in 1824: Gibson, C. J.  The single question to be decided is, whether the enlistment of a minor, into the corps of marines, is void by any act of congress, or at common law. The act which regulates enlistments in the army, prohibits the enlistment of minors, except as musicians  and, on the other hand, the act which regulates the enlistment of. seamen, expressly authorizes the enlistment of minors.  The marine corps has no necessary connexion with the army  it is a part of the naval establishment, and is exclusively subject to the orders of the secretary of the navy. He thinks that the contract of enlistment in the navy, by a minor, is good, independently of the statutes, at common law. Such a contract is good, if for the benefit of the minor, and he is far from being convinced that the contract of enlistment is not of this kind. He puts the case on the ground of public policy, which requires that a minor be at liberty to enter into a contract to serve the state,   whenever such contract is not forbidden by the state itself. This is the common law of England. The petitioner was in confinement, on a charge of desertion. The chief justice said:  The law is clear, that he must abide the sentence of a court martial, before he can contest the validity of his enlistment  Prisoner remanded. Com. v. Murray, 4 Bin. 487, in 1812: The syllabus of the case is:  Under the act of congress of January 31, 1809 (2 Story s Laws, 1109 [2 Stat. 514]), authorizing the president of -the United States to cause to be engaged certain able seamen, ordinary seamen, and boys, to serve in the navy, an infant who has arrived at years of discretion, and has neither father, master, nor guardian, may make a valid contract to serve according to the act, notwithstanding he has a mother with whom he resides at the time, and whose consent was not given to the contract.   An infant owes reverence and respect to his mother, but she has no legal authority over him, nor any legal right to his services.   Under the constitutional power of congress to provide and maintain a navy, that body may by law authorize minors to enter into contracts for service in the navy, notwithstanding such contracts if made by an infant might not be binding upon him at common law.  The opinion of Tilghman, C. J., cites section 8, art 1, of the constitution, giving congress power to raise and support armies, and to provide and maintain a navy  this includes all powers necessary to the object intended. The service of persons, under twenty-one years of age, is useful to the country and to themselves. Certainly infants, not under the control of any other person, may make such a valid contract. He gives no opinion whether infants may not engage themselves in the navy, without the consent of parents, master, or guardian. In this case there was no father, master, or guardian, and the mother had no legal rights. The petitioner was of an age fully to comprehend the nature of the engagement, and there was no person who had any lawful authority over him. Yeates, J.: It has not been contended that an infant under the years of discretion, or one whose services have been engaged by a personal contract, can lawfully engage in the navy. The petitioner was seventeen years and seven months old. His father was dead  his mother had no legal rights  there was no prior contract  and the court presumes this contract which he has made is for his benefit. Bracken-ridge, J., goes on the ground that the contract is for the benefit of the infant. He had neither father nor guardian, nor any means of living, except the trade of a shoemaker, which his health did not permit him to pursue. All idea ofi the act of congress is excluded. The judge will not touch it, as it has nothing to do with the case  he can give no authority to the other contracting party. Congress cannot change the principles of the common law  the legislature of a state, alone, may do it. attorneys:   corrections:  head_matter: Case No. 16,400. UNITED STATES v. STEWART.

      "judges:   parties:  UNITED STATES v. BAINBRIDGE. opinions:  STORY, Circuit justice. The first question is. whether the contract of enlistment, supposing it to have been made without the consent of the father, is valid or not. By the common law, tbe father has a right to the custody of his children during their infancy. In whatever principle this right is founded, whether it result from the very nature of parental duties, or from that authority, which devolves upon him. by reason of the guardianship by nature, or nurture, technically speaking. its existence cannot now be brought into controversy. Ex parte Hopkins, 3 P. Wms. 151  Co. Litt. 88. and Hargrave s notes  Rex v. De Manneville, 5 East, 222  De Manneville v. De Manneville. 10 Ves. 52  1 Bl. Comm. 452, 461. This right, however, is not unlimited  for whenever it is abused by improper conduct on the part of the parent, courts of law will restrain him in its exercise, and even take the custody permanently from him. Archer s Case, 1 Ld. Raym. 673  Rex v. Smith, 2 Strange. 982  Rex v. Delaval, 3 Burrows. 1434  Com. v. Addicks, 5 Bin. 520. By the common law, also, a father is entitled to the benefit of his children s labor, while they live with him, and are maintained by him  but this (as has been justly observed) is no more than he. is entitled to from his servants. 1 Bl. Comm. 453. It has also been asserted, that by the same law a father may bind his children as apprentices without their consent  and thereby convey the permanent custody ot their persons, as well as benefit of their labor, to their masters during their minority. Com. Dig.  Justice of the Peace,  B, 55. But, notwithstanding the aid of the very respectable authorities (Day v. Everett, 7 Mass. 145), it may well be doubted, if this doctrine can be supported to the extent in which it is laid down. The custody of minors is given to their parents for their maintenance, protection, and education  and if a parent, overlooking all these objects, should, to answer his own mercenary views, or gratify his own unworthy passions, bind his child as an apprentice upon terms evidently injurious to his interests, or to a trade, or occupation, which would degrade him from the rank and character, to which his condition and circumstances might fairly entitle him, it would be extremely difficult to support the legality of such a contract. Respublica v. Kepple, 2 Dall. [2 U. S.] 197  Rex v. Inhabitants of Cromford, 8 East, 25. And it would be a strong proposition to maintain that a father might, in time of war, upon the mere footing of the common law, enlist his son as a common soldier in the army, or as a seaman in the navy,   without his consent, and compel him to serve during the whole period of his minority, without a right to receive to his own use any of the earnings of his laborious and perilous course of life. Grace v. Wilber, 10 Johns. 453. In such a contract, there would not even be a semblance of benefit to the minor. It is not, however, necessary to decide these points  and they are commented on. merely in answer to some suggestions at the bar. Be the right of parents, in relation to the custody and services of their children, whatever they may, they are rights depending upon the mere municipal rules of the state, and may be enlarged, restrained, and limited as the wisdom or policy of the times may dictate, unless the legislative power be controlled by some constitutional prohibition. The constitution of the United States has delegated to congress the power  to raise and support armies,  and  to provide and maintain a navy   and, independent of the express clause in the constitution, this must include the power  to make all laws, which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into effect the foregoing powers.  It is certain, that the sendees of minors may be extremely useful and important to the country, both in the army and navy. How many of our most brilliant victories have been won, on land and sea, by persons, who had scarcely passed the age of minority? In the navy, in particular, the employment of minors is almost indispensable. Nautical skill cannot be acquired, but by constant discipline and practice for years in the sea service  and unless this be obtained in the ardor and flexibility of youth, it is rarely, at a later period, the distinguishing characteristic of a seaman. It is notorious that the officers of the navy generally enter the service as midshipmen as early as the age of puberty  and that they can never receive promotion to a higher rank, until they have learned, by a long continuance in this station, the duties and the labors of naval warfare. And to this early discipline and experience, as much as to their gallantry and enterprise, we may proudly attribute their superiority in the contests on the ocean during the late war. It cannot, therefore, be doubted, that the power to enlist, minors into the naval service is included within the powers delegated to congress by the constitution  and the exercise of the power is justified by the soundest principles of national policy. And if this exercise should' sometimes trench upon supposed private rights, or private convenience, it is to be enumerated among the sacrifices, which the very order of society exacts from its members in furtherance of the public welfare. The position asserted at the bar, denying to congress the power of enlisting minors without the consent of their parents, is not a little extraordinary. It assumes as its basis, that a granted power cannot be exercised in derogation of the principles of the common law  a construction of the constitution, which would materially impair its vital powers, and overthrow the best settled rules of interpretation. Can there be a doubt, that the state legislature can, by a new statute, declare a minor to be of full age, and capable of acting for himself at fourteen, instead of twenty-one years of age? Can it not emancipate the child altogether from the control of its parents? It has already, in the case of paupers, taken the custody from the parents, and enabled the overseers of the poor to bind out the children as apprentices, or servants, during their minority, without consulting the wishes of the parents. Act Feb. 26, 1794,   4. It has, without the consent of parents, obliged minors to be enrolled in the militia, and to perform military duties  and although these duties are, in time of peace, but a slight interference with the supposed rights of parents  yet they may, in time of war, expose minors to the constant perils and labors of .regular soldiers, and altogether deprive their parents of any control over their persons or services. In time of war, too, the state may, for its defence, establish and maintain an army and navy  and it would be a strange and startling doctrine, that the whole youth of the state might, unless the consent of their parents could be previously obtained, be withheld from the public service, whatever might be the pressure of the public dangers or necessities. And if the state legislature could, in their discretion, abrogate or limit the paternal authority, it must be for precisely the same reasons, that the national legislature could do it, viz. that it is necessary, or proper, to carry into effect some other granted powers. It has been justly observed, in a work of the very best authority (The Federalist, No. 44), that no maxim is more clearly established in law or in reason, than that wherever the end is required, the means are authorized. Whenever a general power to do a thing is given, every particular power necessary for doing it is included. And I feel no scruple in affirming, that congress, having authority  to provide and maintain a navy,  may constitutionally authorize the enlistment into the naval service of any minors, independent of the private consent of their parents  and that the statutes passed for this purpose are, emphatically, the supreme law of the land. Nor is the exercise of this power novel in the institutions of that country, from which we have borrowed most of the principles, which regulate our civil and political rights. It has even been pushed to an extent, which is not only odious, but has become, in a great degree, subversive of the personal liberty of a large class of meritorious subjects. Minors 'may not only be enlisted into the British navy without the consent of their parents  but they may be forcibly impressed into it against the joint will of their parents and themselves. And even apprentices, regularly bound by contract are not, except in special cases, and for a limited time prescribed by statute, exempted from the like impressment. Rex v. Reynolds, 6 Term R. 497  Rex v. Edwards, 7 Term R. 745  Ex parte Softly, 1 East, 466  Ex parte Brocke. 6 East. 238  St. 13 Geo. II. c. 17. Much has been stated in the argument, in reference to what contracts of infants are void, and what are voidable at the common law. There is in the books considerable confusion on this subject, which has not been entirely removed by the learned discussions in Zouch v. Parsons. 3 Burrows, 1794  and see Burgess v. Merrill, 4 Taunt. 468. The distinctions laid down in another case by Lord Chief Justice Eyre, seem founded in solid reason, viz. that where the court can pronounce, that the contract is for the benefit of the infant, as for instance, for necessaries, there it shall bind him  when it can pronounce it to be to his prejudice, it is void  and that where it is of an uncertain nature, as to benefit or prejudice, it is voidable only  and it is in the election of the infant to affirm it or not. Keane v. Boycott, 2 H. Bl. 511  Rex v. Shinfield, 14 East, 541. It is a material consideration also, that the validity of the infant s act. or contract, is, in point of law. independent of the right of custody in his parent, although this may be an ingredient in ascertaining in point of fact, whether the act, or contract, be for his benefit or not. In short, the disabilities of an infant are intended by law for his own protection, and not for the protection of the rights of third persons  and his acts may, therefore, in many cases, be binding upon him, although the persons, under whose guardianship, natural or positive he then is, do not assent to them. The privilege, too, of avoiding his acts or contracts, where they are voidable, is a privilege personal to the infant, and which no one can exercise for him. Keane v. Boycott, 2 H. Bl. 511. And whenever any disability, enacted by the common law, is removed by the enactment of a statute, the competency of the infant to do all acts within the purview of such statute, is as complete as that of a person of full age. And whenever a statute has authorized a contract for the public service, which, from its nature or objects, is manifestly intended to be performed by infants, such a contract must, in point of law, be deemed to be for their benefit, and for the public benefit  so that when bona fide made, it is neither void nor voidable, but is strictly, obligatory upon them. I say bona fide made, for if there be fraud, circumvention, or undue advantage taken of the infant s age, or situation, by the public agents, the contract could not, in reason or justice, be enforced. It would be strange, indeed, if courts of law could judicially hold contracts to be void, or voidable, which the. legislature should deem salutary or essential to the public interests  or pronounce them invalid, because entered into by the very parties, who were within the contemplation of the law. From these more general considerations, we may now pass to the question, whether the laws of the United  States authorized the enlistment of minors into the navy, without the consent of their fathers. All the acts, from the first establishment of the navy, authorize the employment of midshipmen (who are invariably minors, when they enter the service) and all the acts since the statute of 30th June, 1798, c. 81, including those now in force, and under which the present applicant has been enlisted and held in service in express terms authorize the president to engage and employ  boys  in the ordinary duties of the navy. In no one of them is there any provision requiring the consent of parents or guardians to their engagement, or authorizing them to make it. See Acts 30th June, 1798, c. 81 [1 Story s Laws, 520  1 Stat. 575, c. 64]  21st April, 1806, c. 35 [2 Stat. 390]  3d March, 1807, c. 40 [2 Stat. 443]  31st January, 1809, c. 78 [2 Story s Laws, 1109  2 Stat. 514, c. 11]  2d January, 1813, c. 148 [2 Story s Laws, 1282  2 Stat. 789, c. 6]. The laws manifestly contemplate, that it is a personal contract made by the infants themselves for their own benefit. They are entitled to the pay, the bounties, and the prize-money earned and acquired in the service. This is not denied in the argument. And if the laws be so, then they must, by necessary implication, give a capacity to the infants to make such a contract  and when made, assert its legal validity. Upon any other supposition, the whole object of the legislature would be defeated  for if the contract of the infant, made without the assent of his parent, were void, or voidable, that assent would not, by the mere operation of the common law, change its character. A contract voidable by the common law, cannot be confirmed or avoided by any assent or dissent of the parent thereto. It is binding, or not, solely at the election of the infant himself. And if the contract be void, it is incapable of being set up by any person. To suppose, that the legislature meant to authorize an infant to enlist in the navy and yet that the contract should be voidable at his election, would be to suppose, that it meant to repeal the rules and articles of the navy in his favor, and enable him to desert, when his services were most important to the public. If,- indeed, the acts of congress had authorized parents or guardians to bind their minor children to an apprenticeship or servitude in the navy, a valid contract might then have been made by such parents or guardians. But there is no such authority in the acts, nor am I satisfied, that it ever existed at the common law  and if it ever did, the statute. of Massachusetts of the 28th of February, 1795, c. 64, seems to have restrained the exercise of that power to th'e cases and manner specified in that statute. A different doctrine has indeed been held  but it seems to me extremely difficult to be maintained (Day v. Everett, 7 Mass. 145), and, in a ease depending upon similar principles of construction, the opposite doctrine has been established in another court (Ex parte M Dowle, 8 Johns. 253). Upon the whole, as congress have authorized  boys  to be engaged in the service of the navy, without requiring the previous consent of their parents to the contract of enlistment, that contract, when fairly made with an infant of reasonable discretion, must be deemed to have a semblance of benefit to him, and to be essential to the public welfare, and, therefore, binding to all intents and purposes. And if it were not so binding, but were voidable, even the consent of parents would not infuse into it any farther validity. This construction of the acts respecting the naval establishment, is confirmed by the general practice in that department, and by the consideration, that in the acts respecting enlistments in the army, a proviso was for a long time inserted,  that no person, under the age of twenty-one years, shall be enlisted by any officer, or held in the service of the United States without the consent of his parent, guardian, or master, first had and obtained, if any he have.  See Acts 16th March, 1802, c. 9 f2 Stat. 132]  11th January. 1812, c. 14 [2 Stat. 671]  20th January, 1813. c. 154 [2 Story s Laws, 1284  2 Stat. 791, c. 12]. By the acts of 1812 and 1813, this contract must be in writing. And at length the necessities of the public service were such, that the enlistment of minors, over eighteen years of age, into the regular army, was expressly authorized. And the proviso of the act of the 20th of January, 1813, ch. 154, which required the previous consent of their parents, guardians, or masters was expressly repealed by the act of 10th of December, 1814, c. 10 [3 Stat. 146]. This course of legislation manifestly shows, that whenever the rights of parents were intended to be saved, a special proviso was uniformly introduced for that purpose. The decisions of two very respectable state courts, which have been cited at the bar, so far as they go, proceed on the same principles, which have been adoped by this court, and are entitled to great weight. Com. v. Murray, 4 Bin. 487  Ex parte Roberts, 2 Hall, Law J. 192. The decisions of our own state court, which have been cited on the other side, are inapplicable  for they turn altogether upon the meaning and extent of the proviso in the army act of 1813, c. 154. It is not now necessary to consider, bow far a state court has jurisdiction to discharge a person, who, by the return of the habeas corpus is shown to be enlisted under a contract with the United States. Whenever that question shall arise, it will deserve very grave consideration. See Ex parte Roberts, 2 Hall. Law J. 192  Ferguson s Case, 9 Johns. 239  Martin v. Hunter, 1 Wheat. [14 U. S.] 304. But, with great deference to the learned judges, I have never been able to bring my mind to assent to the construction put upon the act of 1S13, in some of the cases in the Massachusetts Reports. Com. v. Cushing 11 Mass. 67. The view, which has been taken upon the general question, as to the validity of the contract of enlistment, renders it unnecessary to consider the second point made in this cause, viz. how far an infant can, by disaffirming his contract of service, avoid the punishment, which has been regularly adjudged against him by the sentence of a court-martial, for a crime committed by him, the whole proceedings and sentence having been pronounced, while the contract was in force. See Rex v. Inhabitants of St. Nicholas, Burrows, Sett. Cas. 91  2 Strange, 1066  Gray v. Cookson, 16 East, 13  Grace v. Wilber, 10 Johns. 453, 12 Johns. 68. If it had been necessary in this ease to ascertain, whether there had been any consent of the father. I should have thought it necessary to have required more explicit affidavits than have been made, and a peremptory denial of assent on the* part of the father, as well as a special statement of the facts, as to the mode of life and place of residence of the minor previous to his enlistment: for an assent of the father need not be express, but may be implied from circumstances. If a father should voluntarily send his minor children away from home, to obtain a maintenance and support in any manner, that they could  this would be an implied consent to any contract for that purpose, into which they should enter, and a waiver of his parental rights. It is upon this ground, that the ordinary retainers of servants. who are minors, are held valid against the subsequent acts of the father. In strictness of law the contract of the minor in such cases becomes obligatory, because, being an exile from his father s house, whatever contract he forms is, in an enlarged view, necessary for his support, maintenance, or education.   I am of opinion, that Robert Treadwell, the minor, ought to be remanded to the cus tody of his commanding officer. It is the opinion of the district judge, that the consent of the parent, or guardian, when there is one, is necessary, either expressed or implied, to authorize the engagement of a minor in the naval service  but he concurs in the order to remand the said Robert to the custody of his commanding officer on the special circumstances of this case. It has been recently decided in New York, that a parent has no authority to bind his child to military se-vice. Grace v.

By the return of the habeas corpus, and the other proceedings, it appeared, that he was born in Ipswich, on the second day of August, 1795  that in the month of May, 1815. he enlisted into the navy of the United States, to s rve two years  that, after this enlistment, he deserted from the service, and, having been apprehended, was on the nineteenth day of June last past, brought to trial on the charge of desertion before a regular court martial, and, having pleaded guilty to the charge, was, by the sentence of the court, among other things, ordered to serve in the navy of the United States the term of two years from the said nineteenth day of June, and to forfeit all the wages then due to him. He has a father who is still living, and now absent at sea  and who. previous to his departure, sued out a habeas corpus, for the liberation of his son, but it failed, from the return of the officer to whom it was directed, that the infant was tiot in his custody. It was alleged in the affidavits and petition, that the enlistment was without the consent of his father. Mr. Simmons, in behalf of the petitioner. Mr. Ayhvin. in behalf of Commodore Bain-hridge. Mr. Simmons. Robert Treadwell, having a father living, enlisted into the navy without his consent. They now, both of them, wish to avoid the contract of Robert the minor, and obtain his discharge from the service. Is this contract avoidable? (1) Congress have no power to pass an act, .authorizing the enlistment of minors, without the consent of their fathers. Congress liave no power, except that delegated to them in the constitution  and all that is not expressly delegated, is reserved by the states. The  constitution gives congress power  to provide .and maintain a navy, and to make rules for the government and regulation of the same.  All the authority here delegated may be exercised. without any encroachment on the common law rights and relations of parent and child. Those rights and relations, are of as solemn a nature, and as important to be preserved. as contracts. (2) Congress have passed no act, authorizing the enlistment of a minor in the navy without the consent of his father. It is admitted, that the acts o.: congress relative to the navy, suppose the employment of boys. The mode of obtaining them must be by enlistment. as no compulsory process, or general requisition, is enacted. Enlistment is a contract entered into by the United States on one part, through the agency of their recruit.ing officers, and the minor, or the father, or both, on the other part  but by the common law, an infant, under the age of twenty-one years, is rendered incapable of binding himself by contract, except in special cases, as for necessaries, &c. This case is not an exception to the general inability to contract. It was not an undertaking to do, what he was bound to do by law, for it was optional, whether he would enlist or not. It was not a contract for his benefit  the situation of a boy in the navy, qualifying himself for the duties of an ordinary seaman, cannot be considered beneficial, either to his moral or physical habits, promising neither honor nor riches. Neither do the cases of beneficial contracts, that are binding on infants, relate to that general and uncertain benefit, that may be supposed to result from any particular situation, or occupation, but to contracts relating to real estate and specific property. Zoucb v. Parsons, 3 Burrows, 1794. This contract, then, is not an exception from the general rule, and not binding on the infant, but the father is the natural guardian of the son, and has a right to control his person, and dispose of his services and labor  the consent of the father is. therefore, necessary to render the contract valid. In this case, the consent of the father was not given. Is this inability of the minor, or are these rights of the parent taken away by the acts of congress? No words to that effect are used, and it must be by implication, if at all  and such construction is unwarrantable, because it is unnecessary, in order to carry the statutes into effect. Boys may be enlisted by the consent of the father, and the contract is valid  therefore, where no such consent appears, the contract is voidable. But it is said, that the minor having been convicted of desertion by a naval court martial, and, among other things, sentenced to two years  labor in the navy, is barred from having his discharge  because it would annul the sentence of the court-martial. He was there tried for desertion, and, while in the navy, and his enlistment prima facie binding, he was undoubtedly bound to obey the rules and regulations of the navy, and subject to punishment for any violation of them  it is a consequence of his contracts being merely voidable, at his, or his father s instance. The question before this court is the validity of his enlistment  and if he be discharged, the annulling of the sentence of the court martial is only an incidental consequence. It never could have been intended by congress, that the officers of the navy, who appear to be almost a party, should settle a question of this description, especially where the father is interested, and has no notice, and is not heard at the trial. This question must be determined by investigating the power delegated to congress by the constitution, a legal construction of their acts, and the principles of the common law. relative to parent and child, for which a naval court martial cannot be supposed competent, and to determine which, they are not authorized. I have not. been able to find any cases in .point in the English books. In the criminal courts of England, indictments are sustained against indented apprentices for enlisting into the army or navy, and thereby fraudulently obtaining the king s money  from which I infer, they may be reclaimed by their master after enlistment. Mr. Aylwin contended: (1) That the contract, as made by the minor, was a valid one. (2) That if it was in the power of the minor to avoid it, yet that could not be done after he had been legally sentenced by a court martial. The authority given by the constitution to congress, for the purpose of raising a nay, must necessarily invest congress with all such powers as are indispensably requisite for effecting that purpose. If, then, the -nature of the naval service is such, as to require, that the individuals who are employed in it, should become acquainted with its duties at an early period of life, it must follow of course, that congress are empowered by the constitution to authorize the enlistment of minors. In pursuance of this authority we find, that all the acts of congress. upon this subject, make particular mention of the enlistment of boys. That it was the intention of congress, that this enlistment should be effected without the previous consent of the parents, is evident from their having inserted express clauses in the acts relating to the army (in which it is to be remarked an early apprenticeship is not essential) for the purpose of protecting the rights of parents and masters. If the construction contended for is not given to these acts, then the provisions in them, respecting boys, are perfectly idle  for surely parents and masters are not authorized by the common law to bind out their children, or apprentices, to a military service. But it may be observed, that the premises assumed by the applicant, for a discharge, are not founded in fact, or, at least, do not appear in evidence. In this case there is no evidence, that the father did dissent to the enlistment of his son  nor is there, at this moment,' any proof that the father now wishes his discharge. The writ of habeas corpus must be considered as sued out by the minor, and his peculiar rights and privileges are alone to be regarded. It is conceded, that an infant is protected by the common law from all improvident and unnecessary contracts, but all others he is at liberty to enter into  therefore he may contract matrimony, take the oath of allegiance, and. in short,  do all things necessary for the public - good.  Com. Dig. tit.  Enfant,  B, 6. Throughout the whole system of our laws it appears, that beneficial contracts may be made by minors, and even where a certain class of permitted contracts has been subsequently deemed injurious, the legislature has, from time to time, been obliged to interfere and limit the powers of minors. Thus, the general right of contracting matrimony was limited in England, by the statute of 20 Geo. II. But no such limitation has been enacted in relation to serving the public  and, in England, minors may be compelled to serve in the navy  nor was it until the statutes of 2 and 3 Anne, c. 6,   15  4 Anne, c. 19,   17  and 13 Geo. II. c. 17, that they were exempted, during their apprenticeship, and then only for the term of three years. No court of justice ought to suffer it to be promulgated, that a contract to serve the public is not a beneficial contract. It is, to be sure, denied by the counsel for the minor, to be for his benefit, but is it not for the public good? Without condescending to investigate, whether the most honorable and useful of all services can be for the advantage of a minor, it is sufficient to render it obligatory, that thi  was entered into voluntarily, and is for the public good. It being established on general principles, that contracts of this description may be entered into by minors, and particularly where the rights of others are not infringed t do the circumstances of this case form any peculiar exception? Whatever might have been the power of the parent over his child in England anciently, it has been long settled,, as laid down by Blackstone,  that the father may have, indeed, the benefit of his children s labor, while they live with him and are maintained by him  but this is no more than he is entitled to from his apprentices or servants.  1 Bl. Comm. 453. This individual was suffered by his father to roam at large, and gain his sustenance where he could. He sent him into the world with his implied, if not his express assent to render valid any of his engagements, at least, for his support and education: it is now too late, did he interpose and withdraw this assent, to say that stich engagements were invalid. Being thus at large, the infant may eertainly make contracts in relation to the disposition of his person  and if beneficial at the time, they must Dind him. Maddon v. White. 2 Term R. 159. It may be added, that at the common law, the parent had no right to dispose of the person of his child  and it was not until the 12 Car. II. c. 24. that be acquired the right of disposing of the custody of him by will. The sentence of the court martial, it is contended, places this question, however, on a different ground. Assuming for the sake of the argument, that this contract was voidable by the minor, but by him alone (Keane v. Boycott, 2 H. Bl. 511), yet he did not, during his engagement with his government, make known his intention to avoid it by any legal proceedings, or any legal act whatever. And it cannot be doubted, that to enable a party to avoid a contract with the government, some such act or proceeding is indispensable. It appears in this case, on the contrary, that the minor, by a clandestine departure, committed a crime not only against positive law, but against his oath, which bound him to fulfill that law. He is, therefore, now held, not by virtue of his original engagement, strictly speaking, but by the sentence of a competent tribunal, in consequence of the crime that he committed. If his original contract with his country was an invalid one, he ought to have pleaded the disability which rendered it such, at the time he was arraigned. Not having then done it, he must be presumed to have waived his rights, by pleading guilty before the court martial. It was the gist of his defence, that he was not legally bound to serve the United States  unless he was, he could not have been guilty of desertion. The decision, therefore, of that court, having jurisdiction, must be conclusive upon all the world  it cannot, in this collateral manner, be investigated or reversed.\n",

      "judges:   parties:  United States v. William Bainbridge. opinions:  Story, J. The first question is, whether the contract of enlistment, supposing it to have been made without the consent of the father, is valid, or not. By the common law, the father has a right to the custody of his children during their infancy. In whatever principle this right is founded, whether it result from the very nature of the paternal duties, or from that authority which devolves upon him by reason of the guardianship, by nature or nurture, technically speaking, its existence cannot now be brought into controversy. Exparte Hopkins, 3 P. W. 151. Co. Litt. 88., and Hargrave s notes. Rex v. De Manneville, 10 Ves. jun. 52. 1 Bl. Com. 452. 461. This right, however, is not unlimited   for whenever it is abused by improper conduct on the part of the parent, courts of law will restrain him in its exercise, and even take the custody permanently from him. Archer s case, 1 Lord Raym. 673. Rex v. Smith, 2 Stra. 982. Rex v. Delaval, 3 Burr. 1434. Commonwealth v. Addicks, 5 Bin. 520. By the common law, also, a father is entitled to the benefits of his children s labour, while they live with him, and are maintained by him  but this, (as has been justly observed,) is no more than he is entitled to from his servants. 1 Blac. Com. 453. It has also been asserted, that, by the same law, a father may bind his children as apprentices without their consent, and thereby conveying the permanent custody of their persons, as well as benefit of their labour, to their masters, during their minority. Com. Dig.   Justices of the Peace,  p. 55. But notwithstanding the aid of very respectable authorities, (Day v. Everett, 7 Mass. Rep. 145. Matter of Mc Dowles, 8 Johns. Rep. 328.) it may well be doubted if this doctrine can be supported to the extent in which it is laid down. The custody of minors is given to their parents for their maintenance, protec-1 tion and' education   and if a parent, overlooking all those objects, should, to answer his own mercenary view, or gratify his own unworthy passions,, bind his child as an apprentice upon terms evidently injurious to his interest, or to a trade or occupation which should degrade him from the rank and character which his condition and circumstances might entitle him, it would be extremely difficult to support the legality of such a contract. See Rex v. Kepple, 2 Dall. 197. The King v. The Inhabitants of Cromford, 8 East. Rep. 25. And it would be a strong proposition to maintain, that a father might, in a time of war, upon the mere footing of the common law, enlist his son as a common soldier in the army or as a common seaman in the navy, without his consent, and compel him to serve, during the whole period of - his minority, without a right to. receive to his own use any of the earnings of his laborious and perilous course of life. In such a contract there would not be even a semblance of benefit to the minor. It is not, however, necessary to decide these points   and they are commented on merely in answer to some suggestions at the bar. Be the rights of parents, in relation to the custody, and the services of their children, whatever they may, they are rights depending upon mere municipal rules of the state, and may be enlarged, restrained, and limited, as the wisdom or policy of the times may dictate, unless the legislative power be controlled by some constitutional prohibition. The constitution of the United States has delegated to congress the power to   raise and support armies,  and   to provide and support a navy,  and independent of the express clause of the constitution, this must include the express power to make all laxos xohich shall be necessary and proper for carrying into effect the foregoing power. It is certain that the services of minors may be extremely useful and important to the country, both in the army and navy. How many of our brilliant victories have been won by persons, on land and at sea, who had scarcely reached the age of manhood ? In the navy, in particular, the employment of minors is almost indispensable. Nautical skill cannot be acquired but by constant discipline and practice for years in the sea service   and unless this be attained in the ardour and flexibility of youth, it is rarely at a later period the distinguishing characteristics of a seaman. It is notorious, that the officers of the navy generally enter the service as midshipmen as early as the age of puberty  and that they can never receive promotion to a higher rank, until they have learned, by a long continuance in this station, the duties and labors of naval welfare   and to this early discipline and experience, as much as their gallantry and enterprise, we may proudly attribute their superiority in the contests on the ocean during the late war. It cannot therefore be doubted, that the power to enlist minors into the naval service, is- included within the power delegated to congress by the constitution, and that the exercise of the power is justified by the soundest principles of national policy. And if this exercise should sometimes touch upon supposed private rights or private convenience, it is to be enumerated among the sacrifices which the very order of society exacts from its members in the furtherance of the public welfare. - The position asserted at the bar, denying congress the power of enlisting minors without the consent of their parents, is not a little extraordinary. It assumes as its basis, that a granted power cannot be exercised in derogation of the principles of the common law   a construction of the constitution which would materially impair its vital powers, and overthrow the best settled rules of interpretation. Can there be a doubt that the state legislature can, by a new statute, declare a minor to be of full age, and capable of acting for himself at fourteen instead of twenty-one years of age 1 Can it not emancipate the child altogether from the control of its parents 1 It has already in the case of paupers, taken the custody of the parents, and enabled the overseers of the poor to bind out the children as apprentices or servants during their minority without consulting the wishes of their parents. Act 26th Feb. 1794, sec. 4. It has, without the consent of the parents, obliged minors to be enrolled in the militia, and to perform military duties  and although these duties are in time of peace but a slight interference with the supposed right of parents, yet they may in time of war expose the minors to the constant perils and labours of regular soldiers, and altogether deprive their parents of any control over their persons or services. In time of war, too, the state may, for its defence, establish and maintain an army and navy   and it would be a strange and startling doctrine, that the whole youth of the state might, unless the consent of their parents could be previously obtained, be withheld from the public service, whatever might be the pressure of the public dangers or necessities. And if the state legislature could, in their discretion, abrogate or limit the paternal authority, it might be for precisely the same reasons that the national legislature could do it  in that it was necessary or proper to carry into effect some other granted powers. It has been very justly observed, in a work of the very best authority, (The Federalist, No. 44,) that no maxim is more  clearly established in law or in reason, than that whenever the end is required, the means are authorized   whenever a general power to do a thing is given, every particular power necessary for doing it is included. And I feel no scruple in affirming, that congress having authority to provide and maintain a navy, may constitutionally authorize the enlistment into the naval service of any minors, independent of the private consent of their parents : and the statutes passed for this purpose will be emphatical by the supreme law of the land. Nor is the exercise of this power novel in the institutions of that country from which we have borrowed most of the principles which regulate our civil and political rights. It has been pushed to an extent, which is not only odious, but has become -in a great degree subversive of the personal liberty of a large class of meritorious subjects. Minors may not only be enlisted into the British navy, without the consent of their parents, but may be forcibly impressed into it, against the joint consent of their parents and themselves. And even aprentices, regularly bound by contract, are not, except in special cases, and for a limited time, prescribed by statute, exempted from the like impressment. The King v. Reynolds, 7 Term Rep. 479. The King v. Edwards, 7 Term Rep. 745. Exparte Softly, 1 East. Rep. 466. Ex parte Brocke, 6 East. Rep. 238. Stat. 13 Geo. 2. chap. 13. Much has been stated in the argument in reference tb what contracts infants are void, and what are voidable at common law. There is, in the books, considerable confusion on this subject, which has not been entirely J ' removed by the learned discussions in Zouch v. Parsons, 3. Burr. 1794. The distinctions laid down in another case by Lord Chief Justice Byre, seemed founded in solid reason, viz. that when the court can pronounce, that the contract is for the benefit of the infant, as for instance, for necessaries, then it shall bind him, when it can pronounce it to their prejudice, it is void   and that where it is of an uncertain nature, as a benefit or prejudice, it is voidable only, and it is in the election of the infant to affirm it or not, Kean v. Boycott, 2 Hen. Blac. 511. It is a material consideration also, that the validity of the infant s act or contract is, in point of law, independent of the right of custody in his parent, although it may be an ingredient ,in ascertaining in point of fact, whether the act for contract be for his benefit or not. In short, the, disabilities of an infant are intended by law for his protection, and not for the protection of the rights of third persons, and his acts may, therefore, in many cases, be binding upon him, although the persons under whose guardianship, natural or positive, he then is, do not assent to them. The privilege, too, of avoiding his acts or contracts when they are voidable, is a privilege personal to. the infant, and which no one can exercise for him. Kean v. Boycott, 2 Hen. Blac. 511.  And whenever any disability created by the common law, is removed by the enactment of a statute, the competency of the infant to do all acts within the9purview of such statute is as complete as that of a person of full age. And whenever a statute has authorized a contract for the public service, which from its nature or objects is manifestly intended to be performed by infants, such a contract must, in.point of law, be deemed to be for their benefit  so that when bona ma-de  it is neither void nor voidable, but is strictly obligatory upon them. I say bona fide made, for if there be fraud, circumvention or undue advantage taken of the infant s age or situation by the public agents, the contract would not, in reason or justice, be enforced. It would be strange, indeed, if courts of law could judicially hold contracts to be void or voidable which the legislature should deem salutary, or essential to the public interest, or pronounce them invalid, because entered into by the very parties who were within the contemplation of the law. From these more general considerations,  we may now pass to the question, whether the laws of the United States authorise the enlistment of minors, without the consent of their fathers. All the acts, from the first establishment of the navy, authorize the employment of midshipmen, who are invariably minors when they enter the service: and all the acts since the statute of 30th of June, 1778, ch. 81. including those new in force, under which the present applicant has been enlisted and held in service, in express terms authorize the President to engage and employ   boys,  in the ordinary duties of the navy. In no one of them is there any provision requiring the consent, of parents or guardians, to their engagements, or authorizing them to make it.   (See the act 30th Juno, 1798, chapter 81.  of 24th April, 1806, ch. 36.  of 3d March, 1807, ch. 35.  of 31st January, 1809, ch. 78.  and of the 2d January, 1813, chapter 148.) The laws manifestly contemplate that it is a personal contract, made by the infants themselves for their own benefit. They are entitled to the pay, the bounties and the prize money, earned and acquired in the service. This is not denied in'the argument  and if the laws be so, then they must, by necessary implication, give a capacity to infants to make such a contract, and, - when made, to assert its legal validity. Upon any other supposition, _ the whole objects of the legislature would be-defeated. For if the contract of the infant, made without the assent of his parent, were void or voidable, that assent could not, by the mere operations of the common law, change its character. A contract, voidable by the common law, cannot be confirmed or avoided by any assent or dissent of the parent thereto. It is binding or not, solely by the election of the infant himself   and if the contract be void,- it is incapable of being set up by any person to suppose that the legislature meant to authorize an infant to enlist in the navy, and yet that contract should be voidable at his election, would be to suppose that it meant to repeal the rules and articles of the navy in his favor  and enable him to desert, when his services were most inportant to the public. If, indeed, the acts of congress had authorized parents or guardians to bind their minor children to an apprenticeship, or servitude in the navy, a valid contract might then have been made by such parents or guardians. But there is no such authority in'the acts  nor am I satisfied that it ever existed at the common law  and if it ever did, the statute of Massachusetts, of the 29th of February, 1795, chapter 64, seems to have restrained the exercise of that power, to the cases and the manner specified in that statute. A different doctrine has, indeed, been held, but it seems to me extremely difficult to be maintained. Day v. Everit, 7 Mass. Rep. 145. And in a case depending upon similar principles of construction, the opposite doctrine has been established in another court. Ex parte, McDowle, 8 Johns  Rep. 253. Upon the whole, as congress have authorized   boys  to be engaged in the service of the navy, without requiring the previous consent of their parents to the contract of enlistment, that contract, when fairly made, with an infant of reasonable discretion, must be deemed to have a semblance of benefit to him, to be essential to the public welfare, and therefore binding to all intents and purposes  and if it were not so .binding, but were avoidable, even the consent of parents could not infuse into it any farther validity. This construction of the acts respecting the naval' establishment, is confirmed by the general practice in that department  and by the consideration, that in the acts respecting enlistments in the army, a proviso was, for a long time, inserted,   that no person under the age of 21 years, should be enlisted by any officer, or held in the service of the United States, without the consent of his parents, guardian or master, first had and obtained, if any he have. See the act of 16th of March, 1802, ch. 9.  of 11th January, 1813, chap. 154. ' And at length, the necessities of the public service were such, that the enlistment of minors over eighteen years of age into the regular army, was expressly authorized   and the proviso of the act of the 30th of January, 1813, ch. 154., which required the previous consent of their parents, guardians, or masters, was expressly repealed by the act of the 10th of December, 1814, chapter 10. This course of legislation manifestly shows, that, whenever the rights of parents were intended to be saved, a special proviso was uniformly introduced for that purpose. The decisions of two very respectable state courts, which have been  cited at the bar, so far as they go, proceed on the same principles, which have been adopted by this court, and are entitled to great weight. Commonwealth v. Murray, 4 Bin. 487. Ex parte, Emanuel Roberts, 2 Hall s Law Journal, 192. The decisions of our own state court, which have been cited on the other side, are inapplicable, for they turn altogether upon the meaning and extent of  the proviso, in the army act of 1813, ch. 154. It is not now necessary to consider how far a state court has jurisdiction to discharge a person, who, by the return of the habeas corpus, is shown to be enlisted under a contract with the United States. Whenever that question shall arise, it will deserve very grave consideration. See Ex parte Roberts, 2 Hall s Law Journal 192.  Ferguson s case, 9 Johns  Rep. 239. But with great deference -to the learned judges, 1 have never been able to bring my mind to assent to the construction put upon the act of 1813, in some of the cases in the Mass. Rep. Commonwealth v. Cushing, 11 Mass. Rep. The view which has been taken, upon the general question, as to the validity of the contract of enlistment, renders it necessary to consider the second point made in this case, viz. how far. an infant canj by disaffirming his contract of service, avoid the punishment which has been regularly adjudged against him by the sentence of a court martial, for a crime committed against him : the whole proceeding and sentence having been pronounced while the contract was in force. If it had become necessary in this case to ascertain whether there had been any consent of the father, I should have thought it necessary to have required more explicit affidavits than have been made, and a peremptory denial of assent on the Part the father, as well as a special statement of facts, as to the mode of life and place of residence, of the minor, Prev*ous to (he enlistment. For an assent of the father need not be expressed, but may be implied from circumstances. If a father should voluntarily send his minor children away from home, to obtain a maintenance, or support in any manner that.they could, this would be an implied consent to any contract, for that purpose, into which they should enter, and a waiver of his parental rights. It is upon this ground, that the ordinary retainer of servants who are minors, are held valid, against the subsequent acts of the father. In strictness of law, the contract of the minor, in such cases, becomes obligatory, because, being exiled from his father s house, whatever contract he forms, is, in an enlarged sense, necessary for his support, maintenance, and education. I am of opinion, that Robert Treadwell, the minor, ought to be remanded to the custody of his commanding officer. It was the opinion of the district judge, (Davis,) that the consent of the parent or guardian, where there is one, is necessary, either express or implied, to authorize the engagement of a minor in the naval service   but he concurred in the order, to remand the said Robert to the custody tif his commanding officer, on the special circumstances of the case. attorneys:   corrections:  head_matter: CIRCUIT COURT, U.

      "judges:   parties:  Ex parte William Brown. opinions:  The Court intimated that although the term of enlistment was for four years, being two years more than the time for which the father had given his consent, 'fkt it would be a question whether the prisoner ought not to be discharged at the expiration of six years from the date of the contract with Cuvillier. That they considered that contract as evidence of the father s consent that the son should be reenlisted on the 8th of January, 1839, and that although the law required all enlistments to be for a term of four years, the second enlistment was binding for at least two years of the time. Upon the whole, the Couet (Cranch, C. J., doubting, not having had time to examine the various acts of Congress touching the subject,) was of opinion that the enlistment was valid, and remanded the prisoner. Upon a review of all the acts of Congress respecting the enlisting of recruits, there seems to have been no special provision for the enlistment of marines. It seems to have been taken for granted that they would be enlisted in the same manner as recruits for the army are enlisted  and by the Act of 1815, March 3, [3 Stat. at Large, 224,] which is the last upon the subject, they are to be enlisted in the manner and under the limitations contained in the Act of 1802, March 16tb, [2 Stat. at Large, 132,] which by implication seems to admit that minors may be enlisted with the consent of their parent,s, guardians, or masters. attorneys:  Mr. R.

Habeas CORPUS, to Colonel Henderson, of the marine corps, to bring up the body of William Brown, with the cause of his detention, &e. The colonel returned,  as the cause for the detention of the said William Brown, his enlistment in the United States Marine Corps, according to law, as will appear by the accompanying documents, which the undersigned makes part of his return.  The documents were, 1. An enlistment in the following form:   I, William Brown, do acknowledge that I have voluntarily enlisted myself to serve four years in the Marine Corps of the United States, unless sooner discharged, upon the terms mentioned in the Act passed the 11th day of July, 1798, entitled  An Act for establishing and organizing a Marine Corps    and also the Act passed the 2d day of March, 1833, entitled   An Act to improve the condition of the non-commissioned officers and privates of the Army and Marine Corps of the United States, and to prevent desertion    and that I have had read to me the rules and articles of the army and navy against mutiny and desertion.

Sworn before me, at Washington city, this 7th day of January, 1835. Edward W. Clark, J. P.  On the back of this enlistment was the   Size-roll,  which, among other things, stated the age of the recruit to be fifteen years, and says he is   a boy bound to learn music.  2. An indenture of apprenticeship, stating that William Brown, with the consent of his father, William Brown, had voluntarily   put himself apprentice to drum-major Joseph Cuvillier, in behalf of government, to learn music art, trade, and mystery, and after the manner of an apprentice to serve him the said Joseph Cuvil-lier, or any appointed in his place, from the day of the date hereof, for and during and to the full end and -term of six, years next ensuing,  with the usual covenants on the part of an apprentice.  And the said master shall use the utmost of his endeavors to teach, or cause to be taught or instructed the said apprentice, in the trade or mystery of a musician, and procure and provide for him sufficient meat, drink, clothing, washing, and lodging, fitting for an apprentice, during the said term of six years. He shall be further taught to read, write, and cypher as far as the rule of three.  This indenture is dated the 10th of January, 1835, three days after the enlistment, and was signed and sealed by the two Browns, father and son, and acknowledged before Edward W. Clark, justice of the peace. 3. The third document was a new enlistment of  William Brown, on the 8th of January, 1839, for another term of four years. In the size-roll of which enlistment he is called a filer, aged nineteen years. This enlistment extended two years beyond the time of his coming of age, and of course beyond the term of his apprenticeship. Mr. R. J. Brent, for the prisoner, that the enlistment of the 7th of January, 1835, was illegal, because no law authorized the enlistment of minors in the marine corps, at that time. All the acts of Congress respecting enlistments are applicable to the army alone   and the marine corps is attached to the navy only, and constitutes no part of the military establishment of the United States, unless detached for service with the army. The acts relied on in favor of the enlistment, were those of the 16th of March, 1802,   11, [2 Stat. at Large, 132,] 11th January, 1812,   11, [Ibid. 671,] 20th January, 1813,   5, [lb. 791,] and 10th December, 1814]   3, [3 lb. 146.] None of these acts could affect the present case, because they were confined to enlistments in the army of the United States, of which the marine corps was not a part  and wholly under the Secretary of the Navy, and not under the Secretary of War. But the objection to the second enlistment, under which the prisoner is now holden, stands on still stronger grounds. If the indenture signed by the father three days after the enlistment, can be considered as evidence of his consent  first had and obtained,  to that enlistment, yet as the indenture was for six years only, and the second enlistment extended the term to eight years, the indenture is no evidence of the father s consent first had and obtained to this second enlistment, extending two years beyond the apprenticeship. The indenture itself, not having been acknowledged before two justices of the peace, or the Orphans  Court, and recorded in that Court, according to the Act of Maryland, 1793, c. 45,   4, creates no personal obligation upon the apprentice, who was a minor, and incapable of contracting any such obligation except in the manner prescribed by law. It could only bind the father, who would be liable for damages if his son did not perform the services required by the indenture. If it stood alone on this contract, Cuvillier would have no right to retain the prisoner against his will. This contract can only be used as evidence of the father s consent to his son s enlistment  but it is no evidence of such consent to the second enlistment, which extended two years beyond the term of the indenture. The Acts of January 31, 1809,   2, [2 Stat. at Large, 514,] May 15, 1820, [3 lb. 606,] and March 2, 1837, [5 lb. 153,] apply only to the enlistment of boys for the navy, as seamen, not as mariners  and the last only authorizes the enlistment of such boys between the ages of thirteen and eighteen years, whereas this prisoner, at the time of his second enlistment, was nineteen years of age.

      "judges:   parties:  In re Barry. opinions:  Betts, J. On the first day of term the petitioner presented in open court and filed his petition praying that  the people s writ of habeas corpus ad subjiciendum may issue in his behalf, directed to Mary Mercein, relict of the late Thomas R. Mercein, deceased, of the city of New York, and to Eliza Anna Barry, wife of the petitioner, commanding them forthwith, immediately on the receipt of said writ, to have the body of Mary Mercein Barry, daughter of the petitioner, by them imprisoned or detained, with the time and cause of such imprisonment or detention, before this court, to do and receive what shall then and there be considered of the said Mary Mercein Barry.  The petitioner alleges that he is a native-born subject of the queen of Great Britain, resident in Nova Scotia, and that he has never been naturalized, or claimed naturalization, under the laws of the United States  that in April, 1835, in the city of New York, he intermarried with Eliza Anna, daughter of the late Thomas R. Mercein, a citizen of said city  that in the month of May thereafter he returned to Nova Scotia, accompanied by his wife, and there resided about a year, when he removed his family to the city of New York, where he resided until April, 1838, when he returned to Nova Scotia with a portion of his family, and has continued to reside there from that time  that a son and daughter were born of said marriage during his residence in the city of New York, and on his removal to Nova Scotia he left his wife and two children temporarily with her father in the city of New York  that in the month of May thereafter he returned to New York, when difficulties arose between him and his wife respecting her removal to Nova Scotia, and she declared her determination to part with him, rather than think of going to Nova Scotia  that he remained, in New York until the 28th of June, 1838, and, with a view to arrange amicably the differences between himself and wife, he finally agreed to allow her to continue in New York, at her father s house, until the 1st day of May, 1839, and to retain in her care their said daughter, Mary Mercein, during that period, and also their son until such time as the petitioner might think proper to require him  that in September following he returned to.New York, and made every possible effort to conciliate his wife, and induce her to consent to go at some future time to her own proper home, in Nova Scotia, but she utterly refusing, and declaring that she had nq expectation of so doing, the petitioner returned himself, taking his son along wdth him  that these attempts to conciliate her were frequently repeated without avail, and the petitioner awaited the expiration of the time he had agreed she should remain with her father, and on the 2d day of May, 1839, formally demanded of the said Thomas R. Mercein the surrender of his said wife and child, which demand was not complied with  that his wife, from that time to the present period, has refused to return to his home, and has absented herself therefrom, contrary to his desires, and has detained, and does still keep from him, unlawfully, his daughter, who is now in the seventh year of her age  that Thomas R. Mercein has lately deceased, and that thereby the wife of the petitioner is, left without any present property, and little or no prospect of any in reversion, and that she has no property whatever of any kind in her own right, and has no means known to the petitioner for the present- or future support of herself and their daughter, and that she resides with, and is harbored in her present vicious and illegal condition by her mother, Mary, relict of the late Thomas R. Mercein. The petitioner alleges his own ability to provide comfortably for the support and education of his daughter, and especially claims that she is a British subject, allegiant to the crown of Great Britain, at least during her minority. The petitioner sets forth many other matters of aggravation in the separation from him, persisted in hy his wife, and the countenance and support of her by her family in her conduct and refusal to return to her home. These particulars it is unnecessary to rehearse, and the right to the remedy or relief claimed by the petitioner is not, in this stage of the case, to be determined by a consideration of the relative conduct of these parents towards each other or the child, or of the advantages to the infant to be placed with the one rather than the other. These matters would he most material if the case had proceeded so far as to require from the court a decision upon the question as to the fit or proper disposal of the infant. The point now to he considered is whether the petitioner lias presented a case coming within the jurisdiction of this court, or, if this court has cognizance of 1 he matter, whether the facts stated hy the petitioner entitle him'to the interference of the court in the manner prayed for. The same petition, in substance, was presented to the supreme court of the United States, at the last term, and was supported by an elaborate argument on the part of the petitioner. The court observes, (Ex parte Barry, 2 How. 65:)  It is the case of a private individual, who is an alien, seeking redress for a supposed wrong done him by another private individual, who is a citizen of  New York. It is plain, therefore, that this court has no original jurisdiction to entertain the present petition. * * * Without, therefore, entering into the merits of the present application, we are compelled, by our duty, to dismiss the petition, leaving the petitioner to seek redress in such other tribunal of the United States as may be entitled to grant it. If the petitioner has any title to redress in those tribunals, the vacancy in the office of the judge of this court assigned to that circuit and district creates no legal obstruction to the pursuit thereof.  This instruction of the supreme court seems to be regarded by the petitioner as a declaration of that high tribunal that the United States circuit court for this district has the power to grant the relief demanded by the petition. The expression of such opinion by that court, even in an incidental manner, and not on a point under adjudication, would have the highest influence with this court, and would undoubtedly be adopted here as the rule of decision. But the cautious and reserved phraseology employed by the supreme court in respect to the competency of any other United States tribunal to take cognizance of the subject, is, in my opinion, to be regarded rather as an admonition to the inferior courts that grave difficulties rested over the matter, than an assurance to them that their original jurisdiction contained the authority to award the common-law writ of habeas carpus ad subjiciendum prayed for. That court says of itself:  We cannot issue any writ of habeas corpus, except when it is necessary for the exercise of the jurisdiction, original or appellate, given to it by the constitution or laws of the United States,    language plainly not employed to import that a circuit court has in this behalf a capacity transcending that of the supreme court, and can create a jurisdiction to itself by awarding writs of habeas corpus. This opinion of the supreme court, I think, supplies no authority or suggestion in aid of the jurisdiction now invoked, and, taken most favorably for the petitioner, merely leaves the question as to its power to award the writ to be settled by the circuit court in consonance 'with the constitution and laws of the United States. The application to the supreme court was supported by an exposition of this case, intended to show that this petitioner s claim had been unjustly adjudged against in the courts of this state, and that the interposition of that tribunal was necessary to correct these erroneous judgments, and secure the legal rights of the petitioner. That argument, with the decision of the supreme court on this motion, was also submitted to me with the petition when filed. On the perusal of these papers, I at first hesitated as to the course most proper to be pursued preliminarily,   whether to-grant a rule against Mrs. Barry and Mrs. Mer-cein to show cause why the writ should not issue, or even to award the writ, with a view to have the entire case spread before the court, or such points presented as would lead to a definite decision of the case. But, as the adoption of either alternative must involve great delay and expense, both in the disposition of the case in the first instance, and in removing it by either party to the supreme court for revision, and as the right of the petitioner to relief in this court, under any aspect of the case, was doubtful. I conceived it the least expensive and more convenient course to inquire and decide whether the petitioner presented a ease of which this court should take cognizance. When the cause of imprisonment or detention shown by the petition satisfies the court that the prisoner would be remanded if brought up, the writ will not be awarded. Watkins  Case, 3 Pet. 201, per Marshall, C. J.  Milburn s Case, 9 Pet. 706  2 Story, Const. p. 207,   1341  Ex parte Bollman, 4 Cranch, 75. The practice in the English courts is the same. Bac. Abr.

Wiltsheire, 2 Rolle, 138. If, upon the facts stated by the petitioner, it shall be determined that the court cannot grant the relief prayed for, either for want of jurisdiction, or because the law is against his demand, it would be inexpedi-entand oppressive to cause the partiesimplicated to be arraigned before this court, and held under its control, pending the discussion and consideration of the subject, .and, accordingly, upon the doubts arising from a perusal of the papers, I deemed it proper to invite the petitioner in the first instance to support his petition by arguing these two points: (1) Whether the United States circuit court has jurisdiction over the subject-matter of his petition. (2) If such jurisdiction exists, do the facts stated upon the petition give the petitioner, under the law of the land, a title to the remedy prayed for? The petitioner has read an argument, prepared with great research and ability, in support of the affirmative of both inquiries, bringing into review numerous English and American decisions upon the same question, and has submitted the manuscript to the examination of the court. With the aid of this most amjjle discussion of Ibis subject, I proceed to pronounce the result of my reflections upon tins interesting and important case. The incongruity of awarding proofs, at the instance of husband or wife, to take away an infant child from the parent having it in nurture and keeping, upon the allegation that such keeping is a wrongful imprisonment, is most palpable and striking. It is a bold figure of speech, or rather fiction, to which the law ought not to resort, unless indispensably necessary to be employed in preservation of parental rights, or the personal fondness of the child. The courts, however, assume such supposi-titious imprisonment to exist as the foundation for jurisdiction, to a limited extent, over the detention of infants, even by their parents, on the ground that the writ is rather to be considered a proceeding in the name and behalf of the sovereign than by one named person against the other. Com. v. Briggs, 16 Pick. 203. There is no reason to doubt that originally the common-law writ was granted solely in cases of arrest and forcible imprisonment under color or claim of warrant of law. As late as 2 James II., the court expressly denied its allowance in a case of detention or restraint by a private person, (Rex v. Drake, Comb. 35  16 Vin. Abr. 213 ) and the habeas corpus act of Charles II., which is claimed as the Magna Charta of British liberty, has relation only to imprisonment on criminal charges. 3 Bac. Abr. 438, note. It is not important to inquire at what period the writ was first employed to place infant children under the disposal of courts of law and equity. This was clearly so in England anterior to our Revolution, (Rex v. Smith, 2 Strange, 982  Rex v. Delaval, 3 Burrows, 1434  Blissets' Case, Lofft, 748,) and the practice has been fully confirmed in the continued assertion of the authority by those courts unto the present day, (King v. De Manneville, 5 East, 221  De Manneville v. De Manneville, 10 Ves. 52  Ball v. Ball, 2 Sim. 35  Ex parte Skinner, 9 Moore, 278  King v. Greenhill, 4 Adol. & E. 624 ) and this indifferently, whether the interposition of the court is demanded by the father or mother, (King v. Greenhill, 4 Adol. & E. 624  Ex parte Skinner, 9 Moore, 278.) The late act of 2 & 3 Vict. c. 54, (1839,) sanctions the principle, and would seem to reinstate the old dictum, that the judgment and discretion of the court is not to bo controlled by any supposed legal right of the lather in exclusion of that of the mother, if the infant be within the age of seven years. An act of the state of New York passed in 1830 had established the same doctrine within this state by positive law  and, independent of this statute, the course of the American courts in this respect had been substantially in consonance with the decisions in England antecedent to the Revolution. In re McDowle, 8 Johns. 253  In re Waldron, 13 Johns. 418  In re Wollstonecraft, 4 Johns. Ch. 80  People v. Mercein, 8 Paige, 47  Com. v. Addicks, 5 Bin. 520  Com. v. Briggs, 16 Pick. 203  State v. Smith, 6 Greenl. 462. The later cases in New York are founded upon a principle common to all the decisions iqited. People v. -, 19 Wend. 16  Mercein v. People, 25 Wend. 80  People v. Mercein, 3 Hill, 400. But, in solaras they may seem to favor the latest adjudications in England, in respect to the fixed and controlling-right of the father, as the true exposition of the common-law rule, they are modified and overruled by the decisions of the court of errors. Mercein v. People, 25 Wend. 106, and Sittings 1844, MSS. The petitioner-in this case asks of the court the award of the common-law writ of habeas corpus ad subjiciendum, with all of its common-law attributes and efficacy. That is a high mandate, by means of which courts or judges, in protection of the liberty of individuals, exercise functions appertaining to the sovereign power, and which, in intendment of law, rest only in the sovereign, and are co-extensive with his dominion. Kendall v. U. S., 12 Pet. 627, 629. The writ is purely one of prerogative. Whether emanating from a king or a state  whether returnable before the king in person, as it undoubtedly was in its origin, or awarded and acted upon by magistrates as surrogates of the sovereign authority,   it has always been made to bring the party imprisoned directly before the supreme pow'er, that, if there be not due cause of law for his detention, the sovereign-may set him free of his restraint. 3 Bl. Comm. 131  Bac. Abr.  Habeas Corpus,  421  2 Story, Const. 207  Ex parte Watkins, 3 Pet. 202  2 Kent, Comm. 26, 29. In respect to married women or other adults held in detention by private individuals, the sovereign, through this writ, acts as conservator pads and cusios mormn, and, in regard to infant children, as parens patrios, taking, in these high capacities, summary order that the party be forthwith set at liberty, if improperly and wrongfully detained. Blissets' Case, Lofft, 748  In re Waldron, 13 Johns. 418  People v. Chegaray, 18 Wend. 637  People v. Mercein, 8 Paige, 48  U. S. v. Green, 3 Mason, 482. The state thus acting upon the assumption that its parentage supersedes all authority conferred by birth on the natural parents, takes upon itself the power and right to dispose of the custody of children as it shall judge best for their welfare. People v. Chegaray, 18 Wend. 642, 643  Blissets  Case, Lofft, 748. The cases before cited show that the English and American courts act in this behalf solely upon the assertion of the right of the sovereign whose power the administer to continue or change the custody of the child at his discretion, as parens patriae, allowing the infant, if of competent age, to elect for himself  if not, making the election for him. Even in the extraordinary conclusions drawn from the facts brought to light in Com. v. Addicks, 5 Bin. 520, and King v. Greenhill, 4 Adol. & E. 624, both courts, in denying that these facts called for any change of the custody of the children, readjudged the principle that it -was their province, at common law, authoritatively to decide that question according to their legal discretio.n. Does this common-law prerogative in relation to infants vest in the government of the United States, and has the circuit court competent authority to exercise it? The argument bearing upon the first branch of this inquiry assumes two propositions as its basis: (1) That the government of the United States is supreme over all subjects within its cognizance  and (2) that the common law of England is embodied with, and has become a measure and source of authority to, the national government, and is to be enforced in the circuit court whenever persons competent to sue in those courts prosecute their rights therein. It is believed that neither of these propositions can be maintained, and certainly not in respect to the subject-matter of this proceeding. Many of the powers of the general government are unquestionably supreme and exclusive, while others, especially those in relation to remedies afforded by its courts to private suitors, are only concurrent with similar powers possessed by the state governments. If the power in respect to parties competent to sue in the national federal courts could he supposed to exist, in its absolute sense, in the United States government, its exercise has been modified and restricted by congress in the eleventh section of the act of September 24, 1789, which gives the circuit courts no more than' a concurrent jurisdiction with the state courts of suits of a civil nature at common Jaw. 1 U. S. St. at Large, 78. Nor, again, do all attributes of sovereignty devolve upon the national government. Whether considered as emanating directly from the people in their aggregate capacity, or as proceeding from the states in their independent organization and character, the government of the Union is one of special powers, defined or necessarily implied in the terms of the grant. McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 407  2 Story, Const.   1907  Rhode Island v. Massachusetts, 12 Pet. 657. Though the point has been labored with ability by a late jurist of eminence in this department of legal learning, to deduce from the circumstances attendant upon the establishment of this government that the common lawr became embodied in it, as an efficient principle of its authority and action, (I)up. Jur. 85-90,) yet the doctrine has never been declared or sanctioned by our courts. So far as the decisions have gone, they tend to repudiate the principle in loto. U. S. v. Hudson, 7 Cranch, 32  U. S. v. Coolidge, 1 Wheat. 415. There is, accordingly, no sure foundation for the assumption that the federal government possesses common-law prerogatives, inherent in the sovereign, which can he exercised without authority of positive law. Martin v. Hunter s Lessee, 1 Wheat. 329. If any common-law prerogative in relation to the administration of justice can bo proved to exist in the sovereignty of the United States, it must, upon the same principle, ho endowed with all such prerogatives, and can, on the like authority, unless inhibited by positive law, award writs of mandamus, quo warranto, ne exeat, or mandates to citizens abroad to return home on pain of confiscation of their estates, (Com. Dig.  Prerogatives  I) 34, 35,) or this writ of habeas corpus  they being all common-law writs ejusdem generis. That such attributes or functions of sovereignty cannot be inherent in the United States government necessarily results from the character of the government, and the objects of its constitution. It is not designed, in its organization or aim, to regulate the individual or municipal relations of the citizen. These are left under the dominion of the state government  and there accordingly exists no relation between the nation and the individuals which affords foundation lor these prerogatives. The social or personal duties or liabilities of the citizens come within the control of the general government only when remitted to its charge by a special cession of authority, and then solely to the end that such regulations as are of a federal character may be enforced, as in relation to land and naval forces and persons in the employ of the United States, the punishment of offenses, etc.  hut in other respects the national government does not supply the law governing the citizen in his domestic or individual capacity. These particulars appertain to the institutions and policy of the respective states. This reasoning, however, may not be supposed to meet fully the case presented by the petitioner  for although, in the abstract, there may be no prerogative authority in the head of the United States government, yet the argument would maintain that its courts of justice, as organized, may possess all the powers exercised by superior courts at common law, and the issuing and acting upon writs of habeas corpus ad subjiciendum become thereby a branch of jurisdiction necessarily incident to the constitution of such courts. This hypothesis overlooks the peculiar foundation of the United States judiciary, and the allotment of its functions in respect to the powers of the states. The federal government came into force co-ordinately with, or as the concomitant of, state governments at the time existing, and in the full exercise of legislative, executive, and judicial sovereignty. These sovereignties are left entire, under the action of the general government, except in so far only as the powers are transferred to the federal head by the constitution, or are by that prohibited to the states, or, in some few instances, are allotted to be exercised concurrently by the two governments. The United States judiciary is constituted and put in action in the several states, in subordination to this fundamental principle of the Union, and empowered to exercise only such peculiar and special supremacy, and not one in its absolute sense. To render this connection of the United States judiciary with that of the states more intimate and entire, and to take away all implication that it was a paramount power, acting irrespective of state laws, or that it possessed, or could exercise, any inherent jurisdiction countervailing those laws, the act of congress organizing the courts establishes it as an element in their procedure that the laws of the state where the court sits shall be its- rule of decision in common-law cases. It necessarily results, gs a consequence of this special character of the United States judiciary, that it can possess no powers other than those specifically conferred by the' constitution or laws of the Union, and such incidents thereto as are necessary. to the proper execution of its jurisdiction. All other judicial powers necessary to the complement of supreme authority remain with, and are exercised by, the states. This doctrine is sufficiently indicated in the decision of the supreme court made in this case at the last term, and it has been invariably recognized from the earliest adjudications of the court. Chisholm v. Georgia, 2 Dall. 432, 435  Ex parte Bollman, 4 Cranch, 75  Ex parte Watkins, 3 Pet. 201  Kendall v. U.S., 12 Pet. 524. The jurisdiction of the United States courts depends exclusively on the constitution and laws of the United States, and they can neither in criminal nor civil cases resort to the common law as a source of jurisdiction. U. S. v. Hudson, 7 Cranch, 32  U. S. v. Coolidge, 1 Wheat. 415  Chisholm v. Georgia, 2 Dall., 432  Ex parte Bollman, 4 Cranch, 75  Town of Pawlet v. Clark, 9 Cranch, 333  Ex parte Randolph, 2 Brock. 477  Craig v. Missouri, 4 Pet. 444  Wheaton v. Peters, 8 Pet. 658  The Orleans v. Ph bus, 11 Pet. 175  Kendall v. U. S., 12 Pet. 524. It is now argued that this principle is limited to the supreme court, hut that, in respect to the circuit courts, they have a common-law jurisdiction incident to their constitution, inasmuch as judicial sovereignty resides in them, rendering the range of their original jurisdiction coextensive with the subjects of litigation arising under the constitution and laws of the United States, and because all remedies not otherwise provided are, in the exercise of that judicial sovereignty, to bo in conformity to the common law. Although the speculations of our most eminent jurists may countenance this argument, (Dup. Jur. 85  1 Kent, Comm. 341,) yet it has not received the sanction of the United States courts. Chisholm v. Georgia, 2 Dall. 435  Kendall v. U. S., 12 Pet. 616, per curiam, and 626, Chief Justice Taney  Ex parte Bollman, 4 Cranch, 75  Chief Justice Marshall, Ex parte Randolph, 2 Brock. 477  Lorman v. Clarke, 2 McLean, 569. The distinction established by the cases is clear and practical, and embraces all United States courts alike, and is, in effect, that those courts derive no jurisdiction from the common law, but that, in those cases in which jurisdiction is appointed by statute, and attaches, the remedies in these courts are to be according to the principles of the common law. Bains v. The James and Catherine, 1 Baldw. 558  Robinson v. Campbell, 3 Wheat. 223  U. S. v. Hudson, 7 Cranch, 32  Ex parte Kearney, 7 Wheat. 38  Anderson v. Dunn, 6 Wheat. 204  Ex parte Randolph, 2 Brock. 477. It is not, accordingly, conclusive of their right to take cognizance of the subject-matter, to show that the parties connected therewith are competent to sue or be sued in the United States courts, and that there is a perfect right of action or defense thereupon supplied such parties at common law. The evidence must go further, and prove that the particular subject-matter is one over which the courts are by act of congress appointed to act, or that the question has relation to the remedy alone, and not to the jurisdiction of the court. U. S. v. Bevans, 3 Wheat. 389  McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 407  Rhode Island v. Massachusetts, 12 Pet. 721. The authority to lake cognizance of the detention of infants by private persons, not held under claim or color or warrant of law, rests solely, in England, on the common law. It is one of the eminent prerogatives of the crown, which implies in the monarch the guardianship of infants paramount to that of their natural parents. The royal prerogative, at first exercised personally ad libitum by the king, (Kendall v. U. S., 12 Pet. 630,) and afterwards, for his relief, by special officers, as the lord high constable, the lord high admiral, and the lord chancellor, in process of time devolved upon the high courts of equity and law, and in them this exalted one, of allowing and enforcing the writ of habeas corpus ad subjiciendum, became vested as an elementary branch of their jurisdiction. In the performance, however, of this high function in respect to the detention of infants by parents, etc., the court or judge still acts with submission to the original principle out of which it sprang, that infants ought to bo left where found, or to be taken from that custody and transferred to some other, at the discretion of the prerogative guardian, and according to its opinion of their best interest and safety. The reference already made to the origin and object of our Federal Union demonstrates that no prerogative of this character could be exercised as an incident to its qualified and peculiar sovereignty  and I think it equally clear that the inherent authority of no branch of the judiciary can transcend that of the government in this behalf, and that it -has no capacity to issue this writ, or act upon it, except under appointment by positive law. Ex parte Bollman, 4 Cranch, 93. It remains, then, only to consider whether such jurisdiction is conferred upon the circuit courts by statute  for, even if the language of the constitution might import such authority to be within the competency of the judiciary, it is authoritatively established that the circuit courts, at least, cannot exercise jurisdiction as to individual rights, because authorized by the constitution, unless congress has specifically assigned it to them. They possess no jurisdiction other than that which both the constitution and acts of congress concur in conferring upon them. Turner v. Bank, 4 Dall. 10  Bank v. Deveaux, 5 Cranch, 61  Livingston v. Van Ingen, 1 Paine, 45  Browne v. Strode, 5 Cranch, 303  Kendall v. U. S., 12 Pet. 524  Ex parte Bollman, 4 Cranch, 93  McClung v. Silliman, 6 Wheat. 598. The ninth section of the first article of the constitution, par. 2, declaring that  the privilege of the writ of habeas corpws-shall not be suspended unless, when in cases of rebellion or invasion, the public safety may require it,  does not purport to convey power or jurisdiction to the judiciary. It is in restraint of executive and legislative powers, and no further affects the judiciary than to impose on them the necessity, if the privilege of habeas corpus is suspended by any authority, to decide whether the exigency demanded by the constitution exists to sanction the a.ct. So, although the second section of the third article gives the United States judiciary jurisdiction over all cases in law' and equity between our own citizens and the citizens or subjects of foreign states, yet, as already shown, the circuit court cannot, under that provision, act on one of the subjects without an express authorization by statute. McClung v. Silliman, 6 Wheat. 598. In our government the judiciary power acts only to give effect to'the voice of the legislature. Osborn v. Bank, 9 Wheat. 866. The material question in the case must, accordingly, be, whether congress has given to the circuit courts the special jurisdiction appealed to by the petitioner. Judge Story holds that the courts of the United States are vested v'ith full authority to issue the great writ of habeas eorpus in cases properly within the jurisdiction of the national government. 2 Story, Const.   1341. The general doctrine the commentator is discussing, and the authorities supporting it, have relation to the law as it exists in England and in the respective states of the Union. The only ease referred to as giving application of the general doctrine to the United States courts is that of Ex parte Bollman, 4 Cranch, 75. That was a case of imprisonment on a criminal charge, under and by color of the authority of the United States, the prisoners having been committed by the circuit court of the District of Columbia on a charge of treason against the United States  and the supreme court held that, though it could not take cognizance of the mailer under any common-law jurisdiction, yet the act of congress of September 24, 1789, had conferred the jurisdiction, and they proceeded, by virtue of the statute, to exercise it in the case. The court nowhere advert to an implied power in the circuit courts broader than that vested in the supreme court, which would empower a circuit court to grant the writ Upon the footing of a general jurisdiction in respect to the parties to be affected by it. The positions adopted as the basis of the decision would seem to look to an entirely opposite conclusion. Chief Justice Marshall says:  Courts which originate in the common law possess a jurisdiction which must be regulated by the common law, until some statute shall change their established principles  but courts which are created by written law, and whose jurisdiction is defined by written law, cannot transcend that jurisdiction. * * * It extends,  in case of United States courts,  only to the power of taking cognizance of any question between individuals, or between the government and individuals. To enable the court to decide on such question, the power to determine it must be given by written law.  This language of the chief justice is explicit against the theory that the United States courts have necessarily cognizance of all subjects of litigation arising between parties over whom they have jurisdiction. So in respect to another prerogative writ, that of mandamus, the supreme court, in disavowring in itself the power to issue it in the common-law sense, holds, in terms not less definite and decisive, that the circuit courts cannot award it but by virtue of express authority from statute, (Kendall v. U. S., 12 Pet. 524 ) and this conclusion has no exclusive connection with the particular writ of'mandamus, but flows from the doctrine definitely announced by the court, that the United States judiciary has no authority to award prerogative writs of any character further than the power is specifically given by statute. The relator refers to the argument of counsel in the case of Ex parte Bollman, as demonstrating that the fourteenth section of the act of congress of September 24, 1789, imparts to the United States courts authority as ample as exists in the supreme courts of judicature at common law in the application and enforcement of the writ of habeas corpus. No judicial decision, unless it be that of U. S. v. Green, 3 Mason, 482, is found which sanctions that exposition of the statute  and it accordingly becomes necessary to examine with attention the foundation of the construction contended for. The terms of the statute are   That all the before-mentioned courts of the United States shall have power to issue writs of scire facias, habeas corpus, and all other writs not specially provided for by statute, which may be necessary for the exercise of their respective jurisdictions, and agreeable to the principles and usages of law, and that either of the justices of the supreme court, as well as judges of the district courts, shall have power to grant writs of habeas corpas for the purpose of an inquiry into the cause of commitment: provided, that writs of habeas corpus shall in no case extend to prisoners in gaol, unless when they are in custody under or by color of the authority of the United States, or are committed for trial before some court of the same, or are necessary to be brought into court to testify.  The scope and purport of this enactment were very carefully considered by the supreme court. Ex parte Bollman, 4 Cranch, 75  Ex parte Watkins, 3 Pet. 201. The courts being authorized to issue the writ  for the purpose of an inquiry into the cause of commitment,  the supreme court regarded the provisions of the act as incorporating in a considerable degree the English law on the subject, and that the statute of 31 Charles II. had defined the cases in England in which relief could be had under the writ by persons detained in custody, and wras an enforcement of the common law in that respect. The argument of the court tends clearly to the conclusion that our act was to be construed as aj^plicable to the cases embraced within the English habeas corpus act, and as framed in reference to the law established by that statute. If the term   commitment  in our act is used in its common acceptation, it would have reference to the forcible confinement of a person under color of legal protest or authority. In its common-law sense, it imports an imprisonment under a warrant or order on a criminal charge, and no other, (4 Bl. Comm. 296  2 Hawk. P. C. c. 10,    1-3, 13-15 ) and, under the statute, all the judges of England decided that the act of Charles did not extend to any cases of imprisonment, detainer, or restraint whatsoever, except cases of commitment for criminal, or supposed criminal, matters. 3 Bac. Abr. 438, note. Asourstatute uses the term  commitment, and drops the limitation of it in the English act,  for any criminal or supposed criminal matter,  it may be reasonable, in favor of liberty, to understand it in its broadest signification. A court of deservedly high character decided that under our statute a writ of habeas corpus lies to inquire into the cause of commitment, though made on civil process. Ex parte Randolph, 2 Brock. 476. See, also, Bank v. Jenkins, 18 Johns. 309. But it is to be borne in mind that the supreme court hesitated as to the soundness of this interpretation of the statute, for in Ex parte Wilson, Chief Justice Marshall, after consultation -with the judges, on a motion for a habeas corpus, stated that the court was not satisfied that a habeas corpus is the proper remedy in a case of arrest under civil process, (6 Cranch, 52,) and the writ was denied  and to the same effect was the decision of the supreme court of New York. Cable v. Cooper, 15 Johns. 152. If the more extended interpretation of the term be adopted, and cases of commitment for civil or criminal matters may be brought under-review by habeas corpus, yet, in view of the qualified character of the federal government, and the special jurisdiction of its judiciary, the more reasonable inference would be that congress intended the protection of this writ should be interposed by its courts only in cases of imprisonment under color or claim of the authority of the United States. Rawle, an eminent commentator on the constitution, says that the w'rit of habeas corpus is restrained to imprisonments under the authority of the United States. Rawle, Const. 115. Every adjudicated case in the United States courts, with one exception, has been under writs sued out for relief against an actual arrest of a party under process, or his confinement by claim of authority of the United States. U. S. v. Hamilton, 3 Dall. 17  U. S. v. Johns, 4 Dall. 412  Ex parte Burford, 3 Cranch, 447  Ex parte Bollman, 4 Cranch, 75  Ex parte Kearney, 7 Wheat. 38  Ex parte Watkins, 3 Pet. 201  Ex parte Milburn, 9 Pet. 704  U. S. v. Bainbridge, 1 Mason, 71  Ex parte Cabrera, 1 Wash. C. C. 232  Ex parte Randolph, 2 Brock. 447, in which a doubt is made whether the writ may not apply in case of imprisonment on civil process. Judge WASHINGTON, on habeas corpus, adjudged the matter not within the cognizance of the circuit court because the prisoner was not in custody by authority of the United States, and was not committed for trial before any of its courts. Ex parte Cabrera, 1 Wash. C. C. 237. The proviso to the fourteenth section, above recited, looks to such limitations of the writ. It is palpable that congress did not intend that an inquiry into the cause of commitment of a person detained should authorize the United States courts to interfere with his custody unless the subject-matter upon which he was confined was to be acted on and decided by the United States tribunals. This policy of the statute is emphatically indicated by the act of March 2, 1833, c. 57,   7, in which special powers are conferred on the United States courts to liberate by habeas corpus even persons confined under authority of state law, for any act done, or omitted to be done, in pursuance of a law of the United States, or in pursuance of any order, process, or decree of any judge or court thereof. Both clauses denote that it was the violation of a law of the United States, or its just authority, in the imprisonment of the citizen, that was intended by congress to be inquired into and remedied by habeas corpus before the courts of the United States. My opinion upon this review of this subject is that there is no foundation for the claim that there is vested in the United States government a common-law prerogative, or that the circuit court can, upon the footing of common-law prerogative, by writ of habeas corpus, assume and exercise this function of parens patriue in relation to infant children held in detention by private individuals, not acting under color of authority from the laws of the United States. And it also seems equally clear to me that the authority given by the fourteenth section of the judiciary act to issue writs of habeas corpus  for the purpose of an inquiry into the cause of commitment  necessarily restricts the jurisdiction of the courts to commitments under process or authority of the United States. I should, upon the conclusions against the competency of the court to take cognizance of the matter, feel constrained to deny the petition, but for the decision of the circuit court in the first circuit, in an analogous case, where the relief now prayed for was granted. U. S. v. Green, 3 Mason, 482. The jurisdiction of the court was not brought in question, and was undoubtedly conceded by the parties  but the acquiescence in ,a legal proposition so important by a judge of the exact and varied learning of Judge Story, and one whose judicial habit is so cautious and investigating, is an imposing authority in its support. A citizen of New York sued out a habeas corpus against a citizen of Rhode Island, the grandfather of his infant child, to recover possession of the child, which was retained and defended against the demand of the father. The court took cognizance of the subject-matter, and after full hearing decided the question of rightful custody, upon its merits, in favor of the father. It is supposed that the circuit court possessed such authority under the provisions of the eleventh and fourteenth sections of the judiciary act. The eleventh section gives' circuit courts original cognizance, concurrent with the courts of the several states, of all suits of a civil nature, at common law or in equity, etc., when one party is a citizen of the state where the suit is brought, and the other an alien, etc. 1 St. at Large, 78. It is well settled that congress has not in this section exhausted the powers vested in them by the second section of the third article of the constitution, and imparted to the circuit courts cognizance of all cases at common law which might be within the control of the legislative power. Turner v. Bank, 4 Dall. 11  Bank v. Deveaux, 5 Cranch, 61. The supreme court say there is, manifestly, some limitation to the authority of the circuit courts in respect to the cases therein brought within the purview of their jurisdiction, and that those courts have not jurisdiction, under the eleventh section, of all suits or cases of a civil nature at common law. Kendall v. U. S., 12 Pet. 616. Two particulars must concur as the foundation of a suit in a circuit court,   that the litigant parties be competent to sue and be sued, and that the subject-matter be one over which the court has cognizance. Voorhees v. Bank, 10 Pet. 474. A procedure by habeas corpus can in no legal sense be regarded as a suit or controversy between private parties. It is an inquisition by the government   at the suggestion and instance of an individual  most probably, but still in the name and capacity of the sovereign   to ascertain whether the infant in this case is wrongfully detained, and in a way conducive to its prejudice. Neither in England or the states in this country does the court regard this as a suit in -which the right of guardianship is to be discussed or decided. Rex v. Smith, 2 Strange, 982  People v. Mercein, 8 Paige, 48  In re Wollstonecraft, 4 Johns. Ch. 80  In re McDowle, 8 Johns. 253. Judge Story, in the case cited, manifestly took the same view of the subject. U. S. v. Green, 3 Mason, 482. There would, moreover, be a technical objection to this proceeding, if a suit, which the court might not be permitted to overlook. Neither in this country nor in England can an action be prosecuted by an individual in the name of the government without express authority of the court, or the officer appointed by law to represent the public. And no distinction is made between actions popular in their nature, and those in which the private suitor is solely the party in interest. The authority .of the circuit court to take cognizance of the case must, probably, then, be deduced from the provisions of the fourteenth section, in conjunction with those of the eleventh  and the first clause or branch of the fourteenth section must be accepted as giving the courts of the. United States power to issue the writ of habeas corpus, without the restriction of the subsequent clause, to  the purpose of an inquiry into the cause of commitment.  And the eleventh section must be regarded as supplying the parties in -whose behalf such general power may be exercised. The argument was pressed with great earnestness before the supreme court, in Bollman and Swartuiout s Case, that the first clause of this section was to be interpreted as a positive and absolute grant of power, (4 Cranch, 82 ) but the court does not seem to have yielded to that construction, for in reference to that point they say that  ' the true sense of the words is to be determined by the nature of the provision and by the context.  Ex parte Bollman, 4 Cranch, 94. And they evidently regard the whole section as having relation to one and the same matter. The principles established by the supreme court, and brought in review in that case, would seem to militate so strongly against the doctrine involved in the ease of U. S. v. Green as to prevent this court adopting the latter as its guide in determining this point  but, without asserting that such diversity exists in the judgments of the supreme and circuit courts, and admitting that the decision in 3 Mason stands unimpaired as an authority, I proceed to consider the remaining general inquiry,   whether, by the law of the land, the petitioner is entitled to the relief asked for. What, then, is the law which this court administers? For that will be the law of the land in respect to these parties and the subject-matter of this petition. The argument assumes it to be the common law of England, as declared and enforced by her courts, and that the most recent adjudications in those tribunals arc the highest and most important evidence of whatthe law is, and must supply the rule of decision to the UnitedStates courts. This view of the subject disregards the special organization of the United States circuit courts, and the limited purposes they were designed to subserve. They are distributed among the states, to exercise that special jurisdiction bestowed upon the federal government, or shared with it by the state sovereignties, and not to carry with them an inherent power to resort to or employ any other law than that given them by express and written grant. Chisholm v. Georgia, 2 Dall. 432-435  Ex parte Barry, 2 How. 65. Although the people brought with them, on their emigration to this country, the essential principles of the common law, and embodied them in their institutions, yet this was not done by them in a national capacity, (at the time no such character or capacity was contemplated,) but as distinct communities independent of each other. Chisholm v. Georgia, 2 Dall. 435  Bains v. The James and Catherine, 1 Baldw. 557. Nor has the common law been adopted by the United States as a system applicable to the states generally, and to be administered as such in the national courts. Kendall v. U. S., 12 Pet. 621. This has been done specifically by act of congress in relation to the District of Columbia, (Id. ) but in respect to the states the common law is regarded in force only as adopted or modified by the constitution, statutes, or usages of the states, respectively. It came to them, and was appropriated by them, and became an integral portion of the laws of the particular states, before the United States government had existence. 1 Story, Comm. cc. 16, 17  1 Kent, Comm. 471, and notes  Town of Pawlet v. Clark, 9 Cranch, 333  Southwick v. Postmaster General, 2 Pet. 446. In bringing this new government into action amid sovereignties already organized and established, it would be a cardinal object to have the limited share of judicial authority possessed by the national judiciary administered, as far as practicable, in consonance with the laws and usages of the state where the court was placed. Political considerations of the highest moment would exact this. The disquietude and jealousy in relation to this new power would be aggravated tenfold, if, in addition to its authority under a|)pointment of positive law, it could by its inherent jurisdiction supplant local customs and usages, and substitute in their place the common law of England in its primitive plenitude and vigor. There was a deep-rooted attachment in the states to their own laws and customs, while every influence acting on! the public mind at that day would tend to induce alarm and distrust of English law, except only in  so far as it had already been modified and adopted by express authority of the states. All the early legislation of congress manifests the purpose to affiliate the new system -with that of the state, and, especially in the jurisprudence as between individuals, to have the writs of the one government or the other organs of the same law, and controlled by a common rule of decision. This principle was varied only when the constitution of the United States, treaties, or acts of congress provided a specific law for the case. Acccordingly, when congress assigned to the circuit courts sitting within the states  original cognizance, concurrent with the courts of the several states, of all suits of a civil nature at common law,  it was careful to direct  that the laws of the several states, except where the constitution, treaties, or statutes of the United States shall otherwise require or provide, shall be regarded as rules of decision in trials at common law in the courts of the United States, in cases where they apply.  Act Sept. 24, 1789,    11, 34. The supreme court has recently decided that the decisions of the state courts are not laws of the state, within the purview of this section of the act of congress, in questions of a commercial character, and that such questions are to be determined according to general principles of mercantile law recognized by American and English authorities. Swift v. Tyson, 16 Pet. 1. Phe argument upon which the decision is founded insists that only the statutes of the state, or long-established local customs having the force of laws, are embraced within the language of the elause, and that the court has always understood the section to apply solely to state laws, strictly local,   positive statutes,   and their construction by the state tribunals, and to rights and titles to things having a permanent locality, immovable, and intraterritorial in their nature or character. This exposition by the supreme court, so far as it covers this question, is the law of the land, to the same extent and with equal force with the statute itself  and, although a state statute which should declare the laws of the United States a rule'of decision in commercial questions would scarcely be understood to exclude this decision as appertaining to that character, yet under the authority of that adjudication, this court is bound to regard only certain classes of decisions made by the state tribunals as laws of the state, within contemplation of the judiciary act, whatever may be their authority within the state itself. But it would seem, from the opinion of the supreme court, that long-established local customs, having the form of laws, come within the terms of the section, and must be followed by the United States courts as. rules of decision, and that the decisions of the state courts are evidence of what the laws of the state are. The court in the same opinion declare that the decisions of the state courts upon even commercial questions are entitled to, and will receive, the most deliberate attention and respect of the supreme court, though they do not supply positive rules or conclusive authority. Swift v. Tyson, 16 Pet. 19. This decision confirms the general doctrine, before stated, that the circuit court is bound to administer the laws of the state. It perhaps renders indefinite and ambiguous, to some degree, the methods by which the United States court is to ascertain and determine what that law is,   whether, if it is not found on the statute-book, it is to be authenticated by the dicta and decisions of English jurists, or by the adjudications of the local judicatories. The proposition on which the petition rests is that a subject of the queen of Great Britain, resident in Nova Scotia, is entitled, as father of a female child under the ago of seven years, born within this state, tc have that child taken by writ of habeas corpus from the keeping of its mother, and transferred by the judgment of this court to his custody  the mother being a native and resident of this state, but residing in the family of her parents, separate from her husband, and without liis consent, and refusing to cohabit with him. Do the laws of the state of New York give him that right  and, if they do, can they be enforced in this court? The United States courts cannot take cognizance of matters of right created or conferred by local statutes. It is to be presupposed that a case at common law exists, of which the United States court acquires jurisdiction under an act of congress  and the determination of that right is then to be made in conformity with the state law. It is accordingly unnecessary to consider the question which has been raised in the state courts, whether, under the Revised Statutes, (2 Rev. St. p. 477,   88,) there exists in this slate any common-law right or remedy by habeas corpus, because, if the eleventh and fourteenth sections of the judiciary act bring the case within the jurisdiction of this court, it must proceed to adjudicate on it conformably to the general principles of the common law of England, (Ex parte Watkins, 3 Pet. 201,) unless that rule is varied by the local laws.  or need the point be discussed, whether, if an infant is brought before this court on habeas corpus, on the application of its father or guardian, the court can act on the matter as if the writ were presented at the instance of the mother, and accordingly regard the provisions in the Revised Statutes as the rule of decision for governing the case. 2 Rev. St. p. 82,    1, 2. The question now is whether the petitioner can demand as his legal right the writ prayed for, on the facts stated in his petition. The present posture of the case does not raise the point whether the individual cause of action has been adjudicated and settled by the state' courts, so as to bar the party from again prosecuting it  but the proposition to be determined is one general in its nature,   whether the facts stated in this petition entitle any party, as matter of right, to relief by a habeas corpus. This subject has undergone a most searching discussion before various tribunals of the state. , Two of the local judges and the chancellor, on these facts, allowed a writ, but refused to award the custody of the child to the father. People v. Mercein, 8 Paige, 47. The supreme court, on full discussion, adopted a different conclusion, and by two solemn decisions adjudged that the father, under such a state of facts, -was by law untitled to the custody of the infant child. Mercein v. People, 25 Wend. 82  People v. Mercein, 3 Hill, 405. These judgments of the supreme court were reviewed on error in the court of errors, and both reversed that tribunal. Mercein v. People, 25 Wend. 106  MSS. Ops. Sess. 1844. The supreme court based their decisions upon the doctrines of the common law, and not upon the terms of the Revised Statutes, (2 Rev. St. p. 466,   23,) the language of which certainly comprehends the broadest range ever given the writ by the English courts, and might very plausibly be urged as extending it to matters not before embraced within that remedy. Revisers  notes, 3 Rev. St. 784. The substance of the enactment is that a habeas corpus shall issue on the application of any person (by petitions signed by himself, or another in his behalf)  committed, detained, confined, or restrained of his liberty, for any criminal or supposed crinrinal matter, or under any pretense whatsoever,  (2 Rev. St. p. 466,    23, 25,) with some exceptions that need not now be noticed. It must, therefore, be regarded .as the settled law of this state, so far forth as the decision of the court of errors, twice rendered on this point, can furnish the law, that the keeping of an infant female child under  seven years of age) from its father, by the mother, living separate from hinr, and who has it in her nurture, is not, in judgment of law, a detention or restraint of the liberty of the child, and that the father is not entitled by writ of habeas corpus to have such possession of the mother adjudged illegal, nor to have the custody of the child awarded him. These decisions have been stigmatized on the argument as outrages upon the common-law doctrine on this subject, and as devoid of all claims to professional consideration and respect. Most earnest efforts were made to place them in disparaging contrast with the opinions of the individual judges of the supreme court, whose judgments upon the point are overruled by the court of errors  and this, not by weighing the arguments of one tribunal against those of the other on the subject, but by sharp invectives against the constitution of that high court, and the competency of its individual members. This court was solicitous to allow the petitioner the opportunity to discuss his case in all its bearings, and, as his language  was decorous in terms, did not feel called upon to check the course of remarks conducing, and palpably intended, to impute ignorance or disregard of the law, in this respect, to that high tribunal  but I should do injustice to my own convictions if I omitted to observe that, on a careful perusal of the opinions leading to the decisions of the respective courts on this subject, I discover nothing in the ultimate judgments of the court of errors which places that judicatory in disadvantageous contrast- with the one whose opinion it reviews and reverses. Every lawyer, however, is well aware that a decision is not to be estimated merely by the ability or learning displayed in its composition, but, essentially, by the sanction it obtains. . Of what value towards establishing a principle, or fixing a rule of law, is the most erudite opinion of a high judge, when the full bench to whom it is submitted adopts a different conclusion, although sub silentio? What court or lawyer, in searching for and applying a rule of law, rests upon the dissenting arguments of judges in the courts of this country or England, whatever be their grade or reputation? The judgment sanctioned by the court can alone answer the exigencies, and meet the inquiry. The more elevated the rank of the court may be, the higher becomes the sanction of its judgments. Every system of jurisprudence imports in its organization that, upon questions mooted from tribunal to tribunal, the judgment of the one of last resort is conclusive proof of what the law is upon the points in dispute  and this entirely irrespective of the qualifications of the members of such dernier court. A barrister would not be permitted to argue in Westminster Hall that a decision of the house of lords on a writ of error weighed nothing, in settling the law of the case, in comparison with the reasonings of the individual judges on the case in the courts below. A decision by the house of lords ends all question before every tribunal of the kingdom as to the point adjudicated, and this is certainly not founded upon the fact that any extraordinary judicial learning or experience exists in that body, or is brought to act on the subject-matter. That court is lauded by Sir William Blackstone, and English writers generally, as one of the eminently excellent features of the British constitution, and as the most august tribunal in the world. Its judgments of reversal annihilate the decisions of the courts of Ireland and Scotland, rendered unanimously by all the judges, and also of the lord chancellor, and all the judges, barons, and lords of English courts of law and equity  and no party, subject or foreigner, can be permitted to gainsay the efficiency and wisdom of such final determination. And yet, in that court, on the decision of appeals from Ireland and Scotland, in admiralty and in equity, the lord chancellor almost invariably sits and acts as sole judge. Lord Bkouguau asserts that he rarely or ever, when lord chancellor, could obtain the assistance of any other member of the court to sit with him on review of his own decisions, and that he, solely, had to decide questions brought from the Irish and Scotch courts, where all the members of those tribunals had concurred in judgment upon points resting on local and peculiar laws. When the house of lords sits on writs of error, only three lords need bo in attendance. No more, in fact, do attend  and these three may change daily. And it results, in practice, that the three noble lords who ultimately decide that the 12 judges of England have erred in their opinion of the law were neither of them present at the argument on the writ of error. These facts arc asserted by Lord Bkougiiam, in the face of the house of lords, and stand uucon-tradicted. 2 Chit. Pr. p. 587, note A. Whatever obloquy may be aimed at the construction of the court of errors in this state, there are features in its constitution which elevates it most honorably, in comparison with that of the house of lords. At least 21 members must bo present at the hearing and decision of every case in the court of errors, and those members alone who hear the argument take part in the decision  and it is doubted whether any period can be referred to in the history of these two exalted tribunals  since they have had co-existence, in which the professional learning and experience in the New York court of errors was not at least equal in amount to that contained in the English house of lords. The decisions of the court of errors are, within the state of New York, obligatory to the same extent as enactments by positive law. It no more.diminishes-their efficiency that the judgment of one court may be modified or varied by that of its successor, than the vitality of a statute is impaired because it is liable to repeal at the will of the legislature. Such judgments are absolute rules of decision in all cases to which they apply in the state tribunals, (Hanford v. Artcher, 4 Hill, 271  Butler v. Van Wyck, 1 Hill, 438 ) and although, within the doctrines declared by the supreme court in Swift v. Tyson, 16 Pet. 19, they are not laws, in a technical sense, and as such obligator}'' upon this court, still, on the inquiry as to what the law of the state is, such decisions must supply evidence of great weight and cogency. Indeed, what particulars can be regarded as in principle more local or intraterritorial than those which pertain to'the domestic institutions of a state,   the social and domestic relations of its citizens,   or what could probably be less within the meaning of congress, than that, in regard to these interesting matters, the courts of the United States should be empowered to introduce rules and principles, because found in the ancient common law, which should extinguish or supersede the policy and cherished usages of a state, authenticated and sanctified as part of her laws by the judgments of her highest tribunals? . In my opinion, the'rule indicated by the supreme court in Swift v. Tyson, if not limited strictly to questions of commerical law, does not embrace the present case, and that the adjudications of the court of errors, prescribing the laws of its citizens in respect to the custody of infant children, resident in the state, and the relative rights of parents in respect to such children, are rules of decision in this court in all common-law cases touching these questions. But, if not so, and the United States court is to act independently of all control by the decisions of the local courts, and is to determine for itself what the common-law rule is in relation to such matters, the judgment of the local tribunal cannot but be of most imposing weight and significancy as a matter of evidence. I do pot discover that that judgment stands opposed to any authentic evidence of the common-law rule as it existed in England anterior to our Revolution, or which has ever existed in this state  and, if even a doubt might be raised on that point, the inclination of this court, most assuredly, must be to yield to the domestic, and not to the foreign, interpretation of the rule. If it be conceded that the more recent decisions in England establish the law of that country now to be as claimed by the petitioner, they supply no authority here, further than they correspond with the law as clearly existing antecedent to 1775. I am not aware the doctrine has ever been countenanced in the supreme court of the United States that modern decisions in the English courts, unsanctioned by ancient tradition, are entitled to outweigh those of state courts in fixing the final laws of the state. The value of the latest decision, the most relied on, that of King v. Greenhill, 4 Adol. & E. 624, when brought in competition with those of the American courts, upon an inquiry into the reason of the law, is essentially impaired by the declaration of Lord Dunman in the house of lords, (the judge who pronounced the decision below,) that he was ashamed of the necessity which exacted a decision of that character from a British court, and of a late lord chancellor, on the same occasion, that the rule of law announced by that decision was a disgrace to the English character. But T do not feel that it is imposed on this court to revise the subject at large, and determine what is the true rule of the common law in this respect. The United States court in no way acts in supervision of the state courts. The decisions of these tribunals are independent of the United States judiciary, and absolute in themselves, in all cases not subject to review in the method pointed out by the judiciary acts. Ex parte Bollman, 4 Cranch, 96, 97. This case is not in that predicament. The extent of the authority of this court, on the principle of its organization, is no more than to act concurrently with the state court upon the subject-matter of this petition. If that concurrence does not import and exact an entire coincidence: if each tribunal acting within its sphere may examine and declare for itself, independently of the other, what rule of law shall govern the decisions,   that comity at least due between co-ordinate courts, if not that intimate and special relation of both to a common source and standard of law, would demand that neither should rigorously insist upon a principle which would bring it in collision with the other  the more especially that the United States courts should avoid, upon a balanced question, adopting conclusions which, carried into execution, must violate the domestic policy of the state, settled by the most solemn adjudications of its own judiciary. The alienage of the petitioner would not vary this principle, even if it be conceded that, by the laws of his domicile, he is entitled as absolutely to the custody of his infant children as to that of his estate.  No interest, not even one resting in contract, is enforced by a court when it is repugnant to the laws or policy of the place where the action is prosecuted. Pearsall v. Dwight, 2 Mass. 89  Bank v. Porter, 5 Day, 320  Bank v. Earle, 13 Pet. 589. It by no means is an indisputable doctrine of public law, or of the law of this country, that the father of this infant can have here the same legal rights and dominion over it as if horn within the country of his allegiance  for, if so, it might impart to him a power abhorrent to the civilization and Christianity of our age, giving him a dominion no less absolute than one over his chattels, animate or inanimate. I do not, however, go into this topic, nor regard it as having any important bearing upon tlio decision now made. I apprehend it has been sufficiently shown that neither in England, before our Revolution, nor in this state since, has judgment been rendered under a habeas corpus in regard to infants, on the acceptation that the right of the father to their custody was anything in the nature of property, or so fixed in law as to afford a controlling rule of decision to the court. In the use .of the remedy afforded by means of this writ the courts have regarded the father as that guardian first to be looked to, in case a change of custody should be deemed proper, and the infant was not of competent age to make its own choice of guardian  but it has been purely in the apjfiication of the remedy, and for the protection and interest of the infant, and not in subordination to the legal right of the father, that such award is ever made. Nothing is clearer in international law than that a party prosecuting upon the clearest right, under the laws of his country, must still take his remedy in accordance with the law of the court he invokes, without regard to the law of his allegiance, and that his demand of this particular relief is no wajr aided by the consideration that it would be awarded him in England or Nova Scotia. I close this protracted discussion by saying that I deny the writ of habeas corpus prayed for because (1) if granted, and a return was made admitting the facts stated in the petition, I should discharge the infant on the ground that this court cannot exercise the common-law function of parens patrise, and has no common-law jurisdiction over the matter  (2) because the court has not judicial cognizance of the matter by virtue of any statute of the United States  or (3) if such jurisdiction is to be implied, that then the decisions of the court of errors of New York supplies the rule of law, or furnishes the highest evidence of the common-law rule, which is to be the rule of decision in the case  and (4) because by that rule the father is not entitled, on the case made by this petitioner, to take this child out of the custody of its mother. Petition denied. attorneys:   corrections:  head_matter: In re Barry. (Circuit Court, S. D. New York. May 25, 1844.) t. Habeas Cop.rus Custody of Infant. By the common law, both of England and the United States, in virtue of the authority of the sovereign as parens patrice, the writ of habeas corpus will issue to determine the right to the custody of an infant as between parents, who are living apart. 8. Constitutional Law Incidents of Sovereignty Peksonal Rights. The government of the United States has no inherent common-law prerogatives. It possesses only such as are conferred upon it by the constitution, and therefore has no power to interfere in the personal or social relations of citizens by virtue of authority deducible from the general nature of sovereignty. 8. JURISDICTION OF FEDERAL COURTS. The circuit courts have not, as incident to their constitution as such, any common-law jurisdiction. They possess no other jurisdiction than that concurrently conferred by the constitution and congress of the United States. Same Construction of Statute. The judiciary act of 1789, (1 U. S. St. at Large, c. 20,   14,) provides  that all the before-mentioned courts of the United States shall have power to issue writs of scire facias, habeas corpus, and all other writs not specially provided for by statute, which may be necessary for the exercise of their respective jurisdictions, and agreeable to the principies and usages of law, and that either of the justices of the supreme court, as well as judges of the district courts, shall have power to grant writs of habeas corpus for the purpose of inquiring into the cause of commitment: provided, that writs of habeas corpus shall in no case extend to prisoners in gaol, unless where they are in custody under or by color of the authority of the United States, or are committed for trial before some court of the same, or are necessary to be brought into court to testify.   Held, the power of the circuit courts to issue writs of habeas corpus is thereby limited to cases of commitment under process or authority of the United States  and they derive therefrom no authority to issue the writ for the purpose of determining, as betweon parents living apart, the right to the custody of an infant child. 5. Same State Law to Govern Custody of Infant. If, under section 11 of said act, the cucuit courts have jurisdiction of personal rights and duties because of diverse citizenship, or the alienage of a party, then, on application of a citizen of a foreign country residing without the United States for a writ of habeas corpus to have awarded to him the custody of his child, as against its mother and grandmother, who aro citizens of the state of New York, the court will be governed in its decision by the law of New York as determined by its statutes and decisions. 6. Same Alienage of Party Habeas Corpus Custody of Infant. Under 2 Rev. St. N. Y. p. 466,   23, on habeas corpus, and the decisions of the court of errors on the same subject, the fact that a mother, having in nurture her female child under seven years of age, keeps it from the father, who lives apart from her, and in a foreign country, does not entitle the father to a writ of habeas corpus to have its custody awarded to him.

      "judges:  (TODD. Circuit Justice, absent). parties:  UNITED STATES v. ANDERSON. opinions:  McNAIRY, District Judge (TODD. Circuit Justice, absent). The first objection taken by the defendant s counsel in this case is that where a man of any age has signed the enlistment, taken the oath, and been mustered in, no judge has a right to interfere by habeas corpus to discharge him until the war department has improperly refused. The constitution of the United States (article 1,   9) declares    that the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus shall not be suspended unless when in eases of rebellion or invasion the public safety may require it.  Congress could not pass a law vesting the war department with a power which would in effect suspend the writ of habeas corpus. The judges, by law. are vested with the power to issue writs of habeas corpus in all cases where citizens are illegally confined. Men constrained to enlist by force, or enlisted under the age of twenty-one, without the consent of their parents, masters, or guardians, are illegally confined. They are not regularly soldiers, not having been properly and legally enlisted, and are therefore entitled to their discharge upon a writ of habeas corpus. In this case the proof is clear that the son is under the age of twenty-one years. It is next insisted that the habeas corpus issued improperly, the application having been made by the father and not the son, and that, therefore, the writ should be quashed. To support 'this idea the defendant s counsel have cited G Term R. 497  7 Term R. 745  Cowp. G72. In the first case cited the apprentice was twenty-two years of age. The court, in giving their opinion, founded it not only on the apprentice being of sufficient age to judge for himself, but also because he was over the age of eighteen, under which, by the statute of Anne, apprentices could not be impressed. The plain inference is that if he had been under the age of eighteen the impressment would have been illegal, and the apprentice would have been restored to his master upon a writ of habeas corpus. The ease in 7 Term R. 745. is expressly decided on the authority of the first case. It is not stated what was the age of the apprentice, but as the court refer to the former case, it is fair to suppose he was over the age of eighteen. The case in Cowp. 072, is a writ of habeas corpus directed to the commanding officer of a man-of-war. on board of which the two persons intended to be brought up were acting in the capacity of common sailors, but not as prisoners. The court said that if the men were served with subpoenas they might have been willing to attend, and that they could not be brought up as prisoners without their consent. The court cannot conceive that the case has any analogy to the one now before it. except in the general words used by the court  that they can never be brought up as prisoners against their consent.  The court surely never intended this expression to extend to the cases of idiots, femme coverts, minors under the age of discretion, or even to minors under the age of twenty-one who are confined expressly against law. On the other side, the counsel in support of the habeas corpus have cited 1 Burrows, 339  1 Strange, 579  2 Strange, 982  2 Burrows, 1334  1 Strange, 641  1 Burrows, 542.606  2 Burrows, 1115  1 Burrows 687  3 Burrows, 1434  3 Bac. Abr. 5, 6,15. Without referring particularly to those cases it may be remarked that they go to show a writ of habeas corpus may issue at the instance of persons other than the one confined. A husband is entitled to this writ in favor of his wife, a guardian in favor of his ward, and, of course, a father for his infant son. It seems to be granted that the writ may issue at the instance of the father in favor of an infant of tender years, viz., under the age of fourteen  but that, after that age, the child is deemed by law to have discretion enough to apply for a habeas corpus if one is necessary. This presents to the court the principal difficulty, if any exists. But in none of the cases produced does it appear that the person detained was enlisted against an express statute requiring the consent, in writing, of the parent, master, or guardian, previous to the enlistment  and from the strictest examination I have been able to give these cases I feel confident that, had the impressments been made directly against a positive law which required the cooperation of the parent, master, or guardian to make the impressment legal, the writ of habeas corpus might have issued at the instance of persons acting in either of those capacities as the case might happen to be. In the case before me the illegality entirely consists in the want of consent of the parent in writing, and it is obvious that congress did not intend the minor should have any discretion, either as to enlistment or discharge. The whole matter is entirely a concern of the father. Bet him be discharged. attorneys:  Hayes & Montgomery, for applicant.

Army   Enlistment of Minor   Habeas Corpus. The enlistment in the army of a minor without the consent of his parent is a ground for discharge, on habeas corpus, at the instance of the parent. This was a writ of habeas corpus, directed to Colonel Anderson, requiring him to bring up the body of Zebedee Bigby, alleged to be in his regiment and under his command. The application for the habeas corpus was made by George Bigby, the father, in a petition setting forth that the said Zebedee was under the age of twenty-one years, and had been enlisted without the consent of the father, master. or guardian The facts set forth in the petition were well supported by affidavits. Upon the investigation of this case two questions arose:. First, whether this court had a right to discharge the soldier until an application had been fruitlessly made to the secretary of war .' And secondly, whether he could be discharged, as- the application was not made, by him but by his father? The son was about eighteen years of age, and there was no proof that he wished to leave the service of the United States. NOTE. Federal courts have jurisdiction on habeas corpus to inquire into a contract of en-   listment, and to discharge minors enlisted in the army unlawfully or without consent of parents, without any application being first made to any other department of the government.

      "judges:   parties:  Love, Plaintiff in Error, v. Simms s lessee, Defendant in Error. opinions:  Mr. Justice Johnson delivered the opinion of the Court. This, cause comes up from the Circuit Court for the district of West Tennessee. The judgment in that Court.is in favour of the plaintiff in ejectment, and error is brought to reverse that judgment, on the ground that the Court below instructed the jury that the plaintiff there had the better title, and ought to recover. The facts of the cause are exhibited in a bill of exceptions, and, so far as are necessary to illustrate this opinion,, may be stated thus: One Stockly Donaldson obtained a grant of lands of the State of North Carolina, in that region of territory which. lies west  f the Cumberland mountain, and now composes a part of West Tennesse. This grant issued upon an entry made in the office of John Armstrong. After obtaining the patent, Donaldson executed a power of attorney to one Grant, to sell, this land, and Grant accordingly sold it to one Allison, and executed a conveyance to him in due form. This deed bears date'in 1795. But it appears, that two years previous to this sa!e   Donaldson himself had executed a title for the same land to one Adair. And the plaintiff in ejectment noiv makes title through Allison, while the defendant protects himself under the conveyance to Adair, but without connecting himself with it. If the case rested here, there would be no difficulty in it  but, by the laws of North Carolina, no deed passes an estate, unless it be recorded in the county in which the land lies, and that within twelve month? of its date. In this instance, the subsequent deed claims precedence, on the ground of prior registration,, after the twelve months prescribed to the prior deed, and, of consequence, at a time when the prior deed was,supposed to be altogether void, for want of registration. On the point of registration the facts are these. The act of 1.715, which is the registering act alluded to, has been suspended, as to the limitation of time, almost ever since its enactment. A similar provision in the land laws of that State, on the subject of registering grants, has also been the subject of a similar suspension. But as there was no County Court embracing within its jurisdiction that region of country in which this land lay, a new provision is introduced into the suspending act of 1788, by which it is enacted, that persons owning lands of this description, shall register them in. the counties in which they reside  and a proviso, as to non-residents, is inserted, in these words:   Provided always, that persons owning such lands in this State, west of the Cumberland mountain, and not residing therein, shall register their grants for such lands in Hawkins county.  The holder of the junior conveyance from Donaldson, availed himself of this proviso, or (more properly speaking) en cting clause, and recorded it, with all his muniments of title, in Hawkins county. This took place in the year 1797, but the defendant below, the holder of the senior title from Donaldson, did not record his title until the year 1806, when, the State of Tennessee having created a county embracing this land, he committed his deed to registration in the county where the land lay  which was also done by the plaintiff below, four years afterwards. If, then, the registration in Hawkins county was a valid registration, and the effect of it was to vest the estate, to the prejudice of the prior conveyance from Donaldson, the plaintiff had the better title, and the charge was correct. This question will now be examined. It is obvious, that to attribute to the registration in Hawkins county the  ffect here contended for, it is necessary, 1. To attach to the provisions of the 5th section of the act of 1788, a variety of incidents, and to give it fi latitude of construction which nothing but the unequivocal intent of the Legislature could countenance. The word land must be taken to mean muniments of title   the word grant, both patents and mesne conveyances  and words of enactment, which, in their direct and ordinary signification, are solely imperative, must be considered as importing a privilege or exemption. Besides which, all the provisions of the 5th section of the act of 1715, must be incorporated with the 5th section of that of 1788, in order to sustain the implication, th t recording in Hawkins county shall make the one valid, or the failure to record in that place be fatal to the other. This view of the subject would lead to a protracted and subtle discussion, which the conclusions of this Court on other points, render now unnecessary to b.e pursued   and . the subject is only noticed, to avoid the implication, that this Court has acquiesced in such a construction of the clause in question. 2. To give effect to the.registration in Hawkins county, it is also obvious, that the 5th section of the act of 1788 must have continued in force until 1797, when the deed, to Allison was recorded in that county. And this must either be. inferred. from the words of the section itself, or must be the effect of the subsequent reviving acts. In their ordinary and direct signification, the words of the section in question certainly import perpetuity  and did it stand alone, such would be the effect given to it, whether in its operation it be considered imperative or remedial. But the context necessarily limits its duration. Both the title and preamble of the act, declare it to be' to relieve persons, who would be sufferers from neglecting to record their muniments of title in due time. And it would be hard to conceive, a reason why grants and mesne conveyances elsewhere, should be forced upon record within a limited time, and those for lands in this district of country left without limitation as to time. While there was no office assigned for their registration, a reason existed   but that reasonis taken away, when we admit that a proper office was opened for that purpose. The question,, however, does not rest herq   a recording law, unlimited in point of tim , and unaffected by penalties, is an absurdity, since it destroys its own views, when it leaves the individual . at large, to record or not, as he ple ses. And if an additional proof be wanting, to indicate the sense of the Legislature in passing this section of the act of 1788, it is to be found in the reviving act of North Carolina, of 1790, in which it is expressly declared, that the act of 1788 would expire, if not then revived. The idea, therefore, of its being perpetual, in its own provisions, is rejected   and it remains.to inquire, whether it was continued in force up to 1797, when the deed to Allison was recorded in Hawkins county. This must depend upon the several reviving acts passed subsequent to 1788,. And it is perfectly clear, upon collating those acts, that the 5th section of the act of that year had expired, and was dropped, before Allison s deed was registered. In 1790, the State of North Carolina passed a law, reviving, for two years, the act of 1788, with all its provisions   but the State of Tennessee had previously been separated from North Carolina, and the provisions of the 5th section of the act of 1788, appear never to have been taken up in Tennessee. It is not necessary, in arriving at this conclusion, to examine whether the words of the section shall be restricted to grants, or extended to mesne conveyances, or whether to deeds prior or subsequent. In no point of view will this section sustain the re^ gistration   for the .deed is registered as a mesne conveyance, hot a grant, properly so called, and must take effect under those legal provisions which extend to mesne conveyances. The act which purports to reviv  the act of 1788, is that of Tennessee  of 1794  and by that, the right of recording out of the county where the land lies, is wholly dropped. The general words of the act of North Carolina, in 1790, are not . adopted   but the right of recording again, is explicitly brought back to the general policy of the country, that of recording titles in the county where the land lies. Th  question will, no doubt, here occur, whether the Legislature could have intended to impose this duty, while there was no county, and. no Court, in which such record could be made. The answer is, that the question is here immaterial, sinc<  it is enough for all the purposes of the defendant below, if the obligation to. record did not exist at all, until there was a county established   but were it otherwise, the only question here is, whether the provisions of the act of 1794, or any other act prior to 1797, revives the supposed right to record in Hawkins county  whether it grants a privilege, or imposes a duty, as to that particular county, and the right of recording in any other place than where the land lies. The act of 1796, which is that under the immediate protection of which it is necessary that Allison s deed should be sustained in favour of the plaintiff below, contains a simple revival of the act of 1794, without any farther provision. Its meaning and effect, therefore, must be read upon the face of the latter act. There were some other points made in. the argument, which, as the cause must be sent back, it if proper to notice. At one, if not two periods, of the early history of Tennessee, there occurred an interval of time, during which the suspending laws, as they are called, didjnot exist, and that of 1715, of course, operated upon all cases within it. Th t State passed from the jurisdiction of North Carolina in 1790, but its first territorial Legislature did not meet until 1794. By a provision of the act of separation, the laws of North Carolina became the laws of Tennessee, until repealed by the Legislative authority of the ceded teiritory, of, it is presumed, until they, ex-pir d by heir own limitations. Whether an hiatus- occur  d in these suspending laws, at the interval of time, is immaterial in this cause, since the junior deed did not come into existence until after the passage of (he act of 1794.' But between the sessions of-1800 and 1801,. there did occur a chasm, in these suspending laws, which chasm, the defendant in error contended in argument, put an end' to the interest claimed under the prior deed altogether. It is obvious, that this argument assumes for its basis the supposition, that the registration of his deed in Hawkins county was valid.and effectual to this purpose. The opinion has been expressed, that the 5th section of the act of 1788, was not in force at the time when that registration was made. And the Court now recurs to the subject, only -to avoid the imputation, of having admitted the conclusion in favour of the defendant in error, had:the registration in Hawkins county been made while the law was in force. We give no opinion on the operation of the act of 1715, on titles to those lands which were so situated that it was impossible for the provisions of the act of 1715 to be complied with   that is, those lands which- lay in' no designated county. In the present instance, the land in controversy was not included within a county line, until the year 1801. As both deeds were registered in the proper county, after the chasm occurred, they are both equally affected by it  and it has no bearing upon their interests, as made out  nder the registration where the land lies. Another point made in argument, was, that the defendant could not protect himself under the title to Adair, without connecting himself with it. Upon recurring to the words of the charge, we find' it to be, that the plaintiff below had the better title. From this, an inference undoubtedly arises, that if the defendant below had exhibited a better title, the plaintiff could not recover, even though the defendant did not show that better title to be transmitted to himself. Since the registration in the county where the land lies, and which is the only registration deemed valid in this cause, gave the prior registration to the prior deed, and thus took away every claim to precedence from the deed under which the plaintiff below made title, the Court must be adjudged to have erred in its charge upon that subject. On the implied proposition, that the better title might be set up, as a shield against the plaintiff s recovery in ejectment, even though the defendant does not show that better title in himself, we will limit ourselves to the following, remarks : The rule of law, that a plaintiff must recover by the strength of his own title, and not the weakness of his adversary s, must be limited and explained by the nature of each case as it arises. Since the ride is univ rsal, that a plaintiff in ejectment must show the right to possession to be in himself positively, and it is immaterial as to his right of recovery, whether it be out of the tenant or not, if it be not in himself, if follows that a .tenant is always, at liberty to prove the title out of  flic plaintiff, although he does riot prove it to exist in himself. Possible difficulties may be suggested as to the application of this principle to mere tort feasors or forcible disseisors  but besides- that such cases, being  generally provided for under statutes of forcible entry, must be of rare occurrence, it is time enough, when $hey occur, to consider what exceptions they present to the general principle. The last point proper to be noticed, is that made in the former argument, on the question of revocation of the power of attorney under which the junior deed was executed. This was supposed to. be virtually revoked by the prior conveyance of the same .land, executed by Donaldson, who gave the power. And this, on general principles, is unquestionably correct. Whatever liabilities, for damages or otherwise, Donaldson might have incurred by not revoking the power by due notice, it is unquestionable, that a power must cease and determine  when there is nothing left for it to act upon. It will be seen, however, that this question resolves itself into the principal question in the cause, to wit, whether the first deed ever was a subsisting valid conveyance. If it was not, then the ground of the argument fails, for the estate had not, in effect, ever passed out of Donaldson  and if it was, then its effect is complete, without recurring to the ground of revocation.. Judgment reversed.. Judgment. This cause came on to be heard, &c. On consideration whereof, this Court .is of opinion, that the said Circuit Court erred in instructing the jury   that the lessor of the plaintiff' had the better title to the land in controversy.

      "judges:   parties:  Smith v. M'Iver. opinions:  Mr. Chief Justice Marshall, delivered the opinion of the Court. This is an appeal .from a decree of the Circuit Court of the United States for the District of West Tennessee, dismissing the plaintiff's bill. The bill states, that the plain tiff had made several entries for small tracts of land within the die-trict, for which he had obtained patents. That the defendant, John M'lver, claiming title to the same land, under an older grant, obtained by Donaldson and Tyrrel, had brought ejectments against him for the several tracts of land he claims, and has obtained judgment in some of them. That he has attempted to bring the causes before this Court by writ of error, but has been unable to do so, because no one of his tracts is worth two thousand dollars-  though all of them, taken together, are worth a larger sum. The bill alleges, that the grant to Donaldson and Tyrrel is a pretended .grant, purporting to be issued by the State of North Carolina, in the year 1795   that if genuine, it does not cover his land, because it calls for 40,000 acres only, but includes 70,000 within itShoundaries   that the grant is not founded on any warrants, or, if upon any, on those previously granted   and the numbers of the warrants have been inserted in the plat and certificate by the grantees, since the grant issued   that it is probable the grant never did issue, but was stolen out of the office in blank, and was filled up by the .grantees, of all which the said MOver had notice, before he received his conveyance. That M'lver contends sometimes, that the grant issued on One' set of warrants, and sometimes on another, and has caused it to be registered in Knox county, in one way, and in Overton, Where the land lies, in another   and to avoid detection, has torn the plat and certificate of survey from the grant. And, finally, that the State of North Carolina had no power to issue the grant. The defendant demurred to this bill, and on argument, the demurrer was sustained, and the bill dismissed. The first question made in the cause, is the jurisdiction of the Court, sitting as a Court of Chancery. It is contended, on the part of the respondent, that a Court of equity can exercise no jurisdiction in the case, because , the plaintiff has full and adequate remedy at law. The several allegations of the bill have been reviewed   and it is contended, that each of them is examinable at law, and ought to be decided in precisely the same manner in both Courts. If the surplus quantity of land ontained in the patent, avoids the grant, in whole or in part, in a.Court of equity, its effect would be the same in a Court of l w. If the grant be void, because issued without warrants, or on warrants previously satisfied, it is void at law. So with respect to the allegations, that if was stolen out .of the land office   that the plat and certificate of survey have been torn off  that Norm Carolina had no power to issue it   and so with respect to every allegation in the bill. The facts alleged are all examinable at law, and aCourt of law is as capable of deciding on them as a Court of equity. In such a case, the existence of some fact, which disables the party, having the law in his fa-vour, from bringing his case fairly and fully before a Court of law, has been generally supposed to be indispensable to the jurisdiction of a Court of equity. Some defect of testimony, some disability  which a Court of law cannot remove, is usually alleged as a motive for coming into a Court of equity. But, in the case at bar, the bill alleges nothing whicfc- can prevent' a Court of law from, exercising its full judgment.  No defect of testimony is alleged  no discovery is required  no appeal is made to the conscience of the defendant. Facts are alleged, which have precisely the same operation in a. Court of law as in a Court of equity   and the bill does not even insinuate that they cannot be proved at law. The argument on the other side is, that the bill charges gross fraud on thpse under whom the defendant claims, and charges him with knowledge of that fraud   and that Courts of equity have concurrent jurisdiction with Courts of law, in all matters of fraud. Admitting this proposition to be true, to the full extent in which it.is stated, it will not, we think, aid the case. In all cases of concurrent jurisdiction, the Court which first has possession of the subj ct must decide it. The questions in these cases have all been decided at law, and the party can have no right to bring, them on again before a Court of Chancery.. Were a Court of equity, in a case of.concurrent jurisdiction, to try a cause already tried at law, without the addition of any equitable circumstance to. give jurisdiction, it would act as an appellate Court, to affirm or reverse a judgment already rendered, on the same circumstances, by a competent tribunal. This is not the province of a Court of Chancery. The appellant has relied on the case of Winches ter v. Evans, et. al. (Cook's Tenn. Rep. 420.) That was a bill in the Court of Chancery of Tennessee, tobe relieved against a judgment rendered in the State Court of Pennsylvania, on the suggestion that it was a trial by surprise,' in the absence of the party and of his witnesses. The defendant filed a plea in bar, denying the surprise alleged in the bill, and averring that the trial was a full and a fair one, and that the judgment was rendered on all the testimony belonging to the cause. The plaintiff demurred   and, on the argument of the demurrer, the Court said,   taking the matter of .the plea to be true, it would bar an investigation in this Court. If the complainant chooses to.deny the truth of this plea, he can still reply to it, as well as to the answer   and he may then have an opportunity of showing, that there was' not a fall and fair trial  and that, therefore, the judgment ought, in equity, to have no effect. B t while ever I am constrained to believe that there was a full and fair trial in a Court of law, it will be. an objection with me, to a re-investigation in a Court of equity.  This case appears .to the Court to decide the very principle laid down in the preceding part of this opinion. Admitting, then, the concurrent jurisdiction of the Courts of equity and law, in matters of fraud, we think the cause must be decided by the tribunal which first obtains possession of it, and that each Court must respec|, the judgment or decree of the other. A question decided at law, cannot be reviewed in a Court of equity, without the sug-gesti n of some equitable circumstance, of which the party could not avail himself at law Decree affirmed, with costs. attorneys:  This cause was argued by Mr. Eaton, and Mr. Isaacks, for the appellants  and by Mr .White, and'Mr. for the respondents. corrections:  head_matter: [Chancery.

Although Courts of equity have concurrent jurisdiction with Courts of law, in all matters of fraud, yet, where the cause has already been tried and determined by a Court of law, a Court of equity cannot take cognisance of it, unless there be the addition of some equitable circumstance to give jurisdiction.

      "judges:   parties:  Robinson v. Campbell. opinions:  Mr. Justice Todd- delivered the opinion of the-court, and-after stating the facts,^proceeded as follows  The,first question is, whether -the'circuit court were right in rejecting the- evidence, offered by the defendant establish a title in himself under the grant of Joseph? that grant being'posterior in date to the grant-under which the plaintiff claimed  and this depends up- .... . , . , on the consideration, whether a prior settlement right, would, in equity, give the party   title to the*anc^ 03n be asserted also, as-a sufficient title in an actjan of ejectment. ' _ , By the compact settling the boundary line Between' and Tennessee, and the- laws- made in par-suance thereof, it is declared, that all claims and titles*to lands derived from the governments of Virginia, or North-Carolina, or Tennessee, -which have fallen into- * % * respective states  shall reman  as secure to he owners thereof, as if derived from the government ^thin whose line they have fallen  and shall not be? in any wise prejudiced or affect d in consequence of the establishment of the said line. The titles, both of the plaintiff and defendant in this case, were derived under grants- from Virginia   and'the argument is, that as in Virginia no equitable claims-or rights ante-  cedent to the grants, could be asserted, kva court-o  law in an 1 ejectment, but were matters cognizable-in equity only, that the. rule must, under the compact between the two states, apply to all the suits inihecburts in Tennessee, respecting the lands included an those grants. Remedies, in respect to real are according*11 to the lex loci jd sitos.     The general rule is, that remedies m respect to real , , , estates are t  be pursued according to the law of place where the estate is situate. Nor do the court perceive any. reason to suppose that it was the intention of the legislature of either state, in the acts before'us, to vary the application of the rule in cases within the compact. Those acts are satisfied by construing them to.give the same validity and effect to.the titles acquired in-the disputed territory, as they, had, or would have,, in the state by which,they were granted, leaving the remedies to enforce such titles to he regulated by the lex.foni. The doctrine of the state courts of Tennessee,permitting an equitable title to be assented in an action at law, only applies to cases within the express purview of the Matutes of   Tennessee. The question- then is, .whether in the circuit, courts of the United States^ a merely equitable title can be set up  s a defence in an action of ejectment. It is understood that the state courts of Tennessee have decided that under their statutes, declaring an elder grant founded on a younger entry, to be void, tn  priority of entries is examinable at law  and that a junior patent founded on a prior entry, shall prevail in an ac- ion of ejectment against a senior patent founded on a junior entry. But this doctrine has never been extended beyond the cases which have been construed to be within the express purview of the statut s of Tennessee. The present case stands upon grants of Virginia, and is not within the'purview of the statutes of Tennessee  the titles have all their validity firom the laws of Virginia', and are confirmed by the stipulations of the compact: Assuming, therefore, that in the case of entries under the laws of Tennessee, the priority of such entries is examinable at. law, this court do not think that the doctrine applies to merely equitable rights derived from other sources.    ourts  f the United States at com* mon law and to be  not act00j-h  ^ut^Lcwding to the principlesof common lawande^uity England!Thhi conciled  with decisions of the courts of Tennessee, equUab!eStUl  inanacUon'at There is a more general view of this subject, which deserves consideration.   By the laws of the United 1 f J   Slates, the circuit courts have cognizanoe of all suits of a civil nature at common law, and in equity, incases which fall within the limits prescribed by those laws. By the 24th section of the judiciary act of 1789, it is pro vided, that the laws of the several States, except where , . . tt   , the constitution, treaties, or statutes ot the United States, shall otherwise require or provide, shall be r.egarded as rules of decision in trials at common law in the courts of the.United States, in cases where they . J * ply. The act of May, 1792, confirms the modes of proceeding then used in suits at common law in the courts of the United States, and declares that the modes tit proceeding in suits of equity, shall be  according to the p nciples,: rules, and usages which belong to courts Of equity, as contra-distinguished frorp courts of cbiaampn laW)  except so far as may have been provided for by the act to establish the judicial courts of the United States, It is material to consider whether it was the intention of Congress, by these provisions, to. confine the courts of the United States in their mode of administering relief to the same remedies, and those only, with all their incidents, which existed in the courts of the respective states. In other words, whether it was their intention to give the party relief at law, where the practice of the .state courts would give it, and relief tre equity only, when according to such practice, a plain, adequate, and complete remedy could not he had at law. In some states in the union, no court of chancery exists to administer equitable relief. In some of those states, courts of law recognise and enforce in suits at law, all the equitable claims and rights which a court of equity would recognise and enforce  in others, all relief is denied and such equitable claims and rights are to be considered as mere nullities at law. A construction, therefore, that would adopt the state practice in a its extent, would at once extinguish, in such states, the exercise of equitabl  jurisdiction. The acts of Congress have distinguished between remedies at common law and in equity, yet this construction would confound them. The court, therefore think, that to effectuate the purposes of the legislature,the remedies in the courts of the United States, are to be, at common law or in equity, not according to the practice of state courts, but according to the principles of common laW and equity, as distinguished and defined in that country from which we derive pur knowledge of those principles. Consistently with this construction, it may be admitted, tb t where by the statutes of a state, a title, which would otherwise be deemed merely equitable, is recognised as a legal title, or a title which would be good at law, is under circumstances of an equitable nature declared by such statutes to be void, the rights of the parties, in such case, may be as fully considered in a suit at law in the courts of the United States, as they ryould be in any stare court. In either view of this first point, the court is of opinion that the circuit court decided right in rejecting the evidence offered by the original defendant. It was matter proper for. the cognisance of a court of equity* and not admissible in a suit at law. The next question is, whether the circuit court decided correctly in rejecting the deed of conveyance from the plaintiff s lessor to Arthur L. Campbell, for the land in .controversy, made during the pendency of the suit. The answ r that was given at the bar is deemed decisive  although an action of ejectment is founded in fictions, yet to certain purposes it is considered in the same manner as if the whole proceedings were real  for all the purposes ot the suit the lease is to be deemed a real possessory title. Jf.it expire during the pendency of the suit, the plaintiff cannot recover his term at law, without procuring it to be enlarged by the court, and can proceed only for antecedent damages. In the present case the lease is to be deemed as a good subsisting lease, and the conveyance by the plaintiff s lessor during the pendency of the suit could not operate upon his reversionary interest, and, consequently, could not ex  tinguish the prior lease- The existence of such a leape is a fiction  but. it is upheld-for the purposes of justice, und there is no pretencethat it works any injustice m this case. tet o s*offTen nessee phcable to this ease. ^ast question is, whether the statute of limifaof Tennessee was a good bar to the action. It is .. , , , , admitted, that it would be.a good bar only upon the supposition that the . lands in controversy were always within the original limits of Tennessee  but there is no such proof in the cause. The compact of the states does not affirm it, and the present boundary was an amr ic.able adjustment by that compact. It cannot, the  e-fore, be affirmed by any court 'of law, that the land was within the' reach of the statute of limitations of Tennessee until after the compact of 1802. The statute could not begin to run until it was ascertained that the land wa  within the jurisdictional limits of the state of Tennessee. The judgment of the circuit court is affirmed, with costs. The foundations of this doctrine, and of all the other  principles concerning the lex foci, are laid down by Hubecus, in hi* Pmlectiofies, with that admirable force and pre<ci*ion which distinguish the   wprks of the writers who have been formed indie school of the Roman jurisconsults, and which justify the eulogium pronounced upon that school by Leibnitz.

But this doctrine waS'asserted in a case where the plaintiffsought to recover upon a title which, she had conveyed away to a third person  and nothing can be clearer than that the plaintiff cannot recover without showing a subsisting title in-himself. Tf the position in Buller s Nisi Prius were confined to cases of this sort, diere could not be the slightest ground to question its validity But it is supposed to establish the doctrine, that if the plaintiff has a title which is not an indefeasihie possessory title, but is, in fact, better than that of the defendant he is not entitled to recover, if the defendant can , . ... .... show a superior title in a third person, with whom the defendant does not claim any privity.   It is the purposp of this note to show, that the authorities' do not justify the doctrine to this extent ' and if it be true in any case, (which maybe doubted,) it is liable to a great many exceptions, which destroy its general applicability. Speaking upon this subject Lord Mansfield is reported to have said,  there is another distinction to be taken,whether supposing a title superior to-that of the (essor of the plaintiff exists in a third person, who might recover the possession, it lies in thq mouth of the defendant to say sq, in answ r to an ejectment .brought against himself, by a party having a better title than his own. I found this point settled before I. came into this court, that tb ?, court never suffers a niorgagor to set up the tie of a third person against his morgagee.  Doe v. Pegge, 1 T. R. 758. note. The point as to a morgage,h^s been long established. In Lindsey v. Lindsey, Bull. N. P. 110. on an ejectmeht by a second morgagee against the morgagor, the court would not suffer the latter to give in evidence the   title of the .first morgagee in bar of the second, because he was Barred By his own act from averring that he had nothing in the land at the time of the second mortgage. And the principle of (his decision has been repeatedly recognised, both in the English and American courts. Doe v. Pegge, 1 T. R. 758. note. Doe v. Staple, 2 T. R. 684. Lade v. Holford, 3 Burr. 1416.

And in cases where land has-been sold by executors or administrators under   legal authority to sell, it has been settled, that strangers to the title, those who have ho estate or privity of estate or interest, and who pretend to none, affected by the sale, shall not be entitled to set up the title of the heirs, or to call'on the executor or administrator for strict proof of the regularity of all bis proceedings in the sale.

Pratt, 10 Johns. Rep. 381. These cases clearly show thatthe doctrine has been very  much narrowed' down. It remains to consider whether the doctrine has ever been.,established, that a mere .superior outstanding title in a third person, with whom the defendant has no privity, can be given in evidence in an ejectment, to defeat a possessory title in the plaintiff, which is superior to that of the defendant. It is manifest, that at the time when .Lord Mansfield delivered his opinion in Doe v. Pegge, (1 T. R. 758. note,) he did not consider any such doctrine as established, for he confines his opinion to the mere case of a mortgagee as against his mortgagor, although- he   states, the question in the broadest terms   and'if the de- . . , cisions had then gone the whole length,  he  would certainly have so stated. Nor is there ariy subsequent case in   England in which the point has been decided. The case of Doe v. Reade, 8 East. 353. tutned upon the circumstance that the defendant, being Jaw-'fully in possession, might defend 'himself upon his  title, though twenty years had run against him before he took possession, the plaintiff' in ejectment not claiming under  the prior adverse possession j and the case of Goodtitle v. Balwin, 11 East. 488. turned  pon the distinction, that the premises were Crown   lands,  which by statute could not be granted, and that the pos,session of the plaintiff and* .defendant was to be presumed by the license of the crown. Undoubtedly the' plaintiff ntust show that he has a good  possessory title  and, thelefore if the defendant shows that he has conveyed the land, unless, the conveyance was void by reason of a prior disseisin, the plaintiff cannot recover. Gould v. Newman, 6 Mass. Rep. 239. Wolcott v. Knight 6 Mass. Rep. 418. Everenden v. Beaumont, 7 Mass. Rep. 76. Williams v. Jackson, 5 Johns. Rep. 489. Phelps v. Sage, 2 Day's Rep. 151. So a tenant mayspow that the title of his landlord has expired. England v. Slade, 4 T. R. 682. So in an ejectment by a ccstvy que trust the tenant may setup in bis defence the legal oulstar ding title in the trustee. Doe v. Staples, 2 T. R. 684. For in all these cases the evidence shows that the plaintiff has no subsisting possessory title at law, and therefore, he ought not to be permitted to disturb the tenant s possession. The general rule is, that possession constitutes a sufficient title against every person not having a better title   and therefore the tenant may stand upon his mere naked possession until a better title is shown.  In sequali jure melior est  conditio possidentis   he that hath possession of lands, though it.be by disseisin  hath a right against alimen but against him that hath right.  Doct. & Stud. 9. 3 Shep. Abr. 26. and the rule -of the civil law is the same. Non possesserio-incurnbit neqessitas probandi possessionesadsepertinere, Cod.lib. 4 cited 2 Bro. Adm. & Civ. Law, 371. note. And possesssion, although it be 'merely a naked possession, or acquired by wrong, as by disseisen, is also a title upon which a re-   covery can be had. .For as Blackstone justly observes,   in   the mean time, till some 1 act be done by the rightful owner to-devest the possession and assert his title, such actual possession is -printa facie evidence,of a legal title in the possession   and it may, by length of time aud .negligence of him who hath the right, by degrees ripen into a perfect' and indefeasible title. 2 Bl. Com. 196. So Jenkins, in his -Centuries of Reports, (42.) states that the first possession without' any other title, serves in an assize for land. In Bateman v. Allen, Cro. Eliz. 437, it was held that the plaintiff was entitled to recover in ejectment where it was found by special verdict that the defendant had ' not the first pqssession, nor entered under title, but upon the plaintiff s possession. And in Allen v. Rivington, 2 Saun. R. 111, where, upon a special  verdict in ejectment, it appeared that the plaintiff had a priority ofpossession, and no title was found for the defendant, Saunders say's, the matter in law was never argued, fgr .the' priority of possession alone gives a good title to the lessor of the plaintiff against the defendant, and all the world, excepting against the rightful owner. And in a late case, it was held, that mere prior ocr cupancy of land, however recent, gives a good title to the occupier, whereupon he may recover, as plaintiff, againsf a l the world, except such as can prove an older and better title in themselves. Catteris v. Cooper, 4 Taunt. 547. See also, 8 East. 353. And this doctrine has been frequently recognized in the American courts. Jackson v. Hazen, 2 Johns. Rep. 22. Jackson v. Harder, 4 Johns. Rep. 202. The last case, 4 Johns. Rep. 202. goes farther, and decides that a mere intruder upon lands shall not be permitted to protect his intrusion in a suit by the person upon whom he has intruded, by setting up an outstanding title-in a stranger.' And in Smith v. Lorillard, 10 Johns. Rep. 338. all the authorities were reviewed, and it was held that if is not necessary fpr the plaintiffjn eject ment to show, in every case, a possession of twenty years, or a paper title   tfiat a possession for a less period will-form a presumption of title sufficient to put the tenant upon his defence   and that a prior possession short of twenty years, under a claim, or assertion of right, will prevail over a subsequent possession.of less than 20 years, when no other evidence of title appears on either side. -In respect to real actions, it is said by Chief Justice Parsons, that under the generalissuet he defendant cannot give in evidence a title under which he does not qlaim,unless it be to rebut the demandant s evidence .of seisin   but that may plead in bar a conveyance by thes demandant to a third person, under whom he does not claim   for iftenant have no right, yet if the demandant haVe no right, he cannot, in law, draw into question the tenant s seisin, whether acquired by right or ' by wrong, Wolcott v. Knight, 6 Mass. Rep. 418. Gould v. Mewman, 6 Mass. Rep. 239.   It is remarkable that in none of . the foregoing cases the point is stated to have been  ever decided upon the naked question whether a better subsisting title in a third person can1 be given in evidence by a defend ' dant who lias-no privity with that-title, to defeat a- i le in the plaintiff which is yet superior to thatund'er which the defendant holds the land. Blackstoneputs a case in point:  If tenant in tai.l enfeoffs A. in fee simpl  and dies, and B. disseizes A., nowi.B. will have the possession, A. the right.of fiossession, and the issue in tail the right of property.. A. tnay recover the possession against B. and after-wards the issue in tail may evict A., and unite in   himsfelf the possession, the right of possession, and also the right of property.  2 Bl. Com. 193. Here B. is an intruder, and, therefore, comes within the'reach of-the case of Jackson v. Harder, 4 Johns. Rep. 202. But if B. had conveyed to C., . and then A.,. had brought an ejectment against .C., could the latter have set up the title of the issue in tail, with which he had no privity ' although that were a good subsisting superior title to defeat the recovery of A.?

Robinson v. Campbell. the compact of  802, settling the boundary lina'between Virginia trait Tennessee, and the laws made in pursuance thereof, it is declared that  all claims and titles to lands derived, from Virginia, or North Cnrolbia, or Tennessee, which'have fallen into the respective states, shall remain as secure to the owners thereof, as if derived from the government within whose boundary (hey have fallen, and shall not be prejudiced'  pr affected by the establishment of the line. Where 'the titles,'both of the plaintiff and defendant in ejectment were derived under grant* from Virginia, to lands which fell within the limits of Tennessee, it was held that a prior settlement right thereto which would, in equity, give the party a title, could not:be asserted as a sufficient titlo in an action of ejectment brought in the circuit couit'of Tennessee. Although the state courts of Tennessee have decided, (hat under their statutes declaring an elder grant founded on a junior entry tobevoid, a junior patent founded on a prior entry, shall prevail at law against g senior.patent.'founded on a junior entry'  .this doctrine, has never been extended beyond cases within the express purview of the statute of Tennessee, and could not apply to the present case of titles deriving all their validity.from the laws of Virginia, and confirmed by the compact between the two states.

Conveyance by the plaintiffs lessor during the pendency of an action of ejectment, can only operate upon his reversionary interest, and cannot extinguish the prior lease. The -existence of such lease is a fie* tion: but it is upheld for tho purposes of justice.

Error to the district court of East Tenessee. This was an action of ejectment brought by the defendant in error, (the plaintiff s lessor in the court below,) against the present plaintiff, and S'. Martin, on the 4th of February, 1807, in the district court for the district of East Tennese.e, which possessed circuit court powers. The d fendant in that court pleaded separately the. general issue, as to 400 acres, and disclaimed all fight to the residue of the tract specified in the declaration. A verdict was given for the plaintiff in October term, 1812. From the statement contaihed'in the bill of exceptions, taken' at the trial of the cause, it appears that the land for which the action was brought, is situated between two lines, run in 1779 I-y Walker and Henderson, as the boundary lines of Virginia and North Carolina^ The former state claimed jurisdiction to the line run by Walker, and the latter to the line run by Henderson. After the separation of Tennessee from North Carolina, the controversy between Virginia and Tennessee, as to boundary, was settled in 1802, by gunning a line equidistant from the former lines. The land in dispute fell within, the state of Tennessee. Both the litigant parties claimed under grants issued by the state of Virginia, the titles to lands derived from the said state having been protected by the act of Tennessee, passed in 1803 for the settlement of the boundary line. The plaintiff rested his title on a grant, (founded on   treasury warrant) to John Jones, dated August the 1st, 1787, for 3,000 acreg   1,500 acres of which were conveyed to the lessor by Jones, on. the 14th of April 1788  and proved pqssession in the defendant when the suit was commenced. The-defendant,-to support his title to the said 400 acres, offered in evidence a grant f r the same to Joseph Martin, dated January 1st, 1788, founded on a settlement-right, and intermediate conveyances to himself.1 He also offered in evidence, that a settlement was made on said land, in 1778, by William Fitzgerald, who assigned his-s ttlement-ri'ght to the said Joseph Martin  that a certificate in right' of settlement .was issued to Martin by the commissioners for adjust* ing tifj^s'to impatefited lands  on which certificate, and on the payment, of the composition money, the above grant was issued. This evidence was rejected by the court below. The defendant also offered in'efidenc  a deed of conveyance from the plaintiff s lessor to Arthur L. Campbell, dated January 2d, 1810, for the land in dispute  but the same was also rejected. He. also claim d the benefit of the statute of limitations of the state of Tennessee, on the ground that he, and those under whom he. claims, had be,en in continued and peaceable possession of the 40Q acres since the year 1788. The court decided that the statute did not apply. The cause was then brought before this court by. writ of error. Feb. 24th. Mr.  aw for the plaintiff in error, argued, 1. That the'defendant below ou^ht to ha vie been permitted to give evidence showing that his . grant had preference in eq ity over the plaintiff s grant. By the law, as settled in Tennessee, the. prior settlement right' of the defendant, though an equitable title, might be set up as a sufficient title jn an action at law. The opinion of the judge below proceeds on the idea that the Virginia practice must prevail, under which such a title could only be asserted in equity. The acts .-for carrying into effect the compact settling the boundary, declare that the claims and titles'derived from Virginia shall not be .affected or prejudiced by the change of jurisdictio h. But are the claims and titles less secure, if the forms of legal proceedings of Tennessee be adopted? Is there any difference whether the plaintiff ^ grant be vacated on the equity side of the court, or rendered inoperative in an actioin of ejectment? It is admitted, that as to the nature, validity, and construction or contracts, the lex loci must prevail. But the tribunals of one Country' hive never carried theif courtesy to other countries so far as to eh&oge the form of action, and  the course of judicial proceedings, or the time within which the . action must be commenced. 2. The deed from the plaintiff s lessor, pending the suit, showed an outstanding title in another, and ought to have prevented the plaintiff from recovering, 3i It is a universal principle that the statute of limitations of the place where the' suit is brought is to govern in determining the time within, which a suit must be commenced 4. New exceptions to the operation of the statute off limitations as to real property cannot be constructively established' by the courts. The statute of limitations of Tennessee ought to he applied to suits commenced in the courts of Tennessee for lands which were always, within the jurisdiction of that state as claimed by her, and which fell within her territory upon the final settlement of' the boundary. The title to such lands pay be determinable only by the law of. Virginia  but the mode of pursuing the remedy on that title must   depend upon the lex fori. The Attorney-General, contra, insisted, that by the compact between the two states, the law of Virginia, was made the law of the titles to these lands. By the settled practice of that state, as Well as the established doctrine of the common law, the legal title-must prevail ii. a court of law. The case of real property is an exception to the general rule, as -to applying the statute of limitations according to the lex fori, and not according to the iea: loci. Generally speaking, suits for such property jaust be commenced in the courts, of the'country where the land lies, and, cousequently, both the right and the remedy are to be determined by one and the same law. But this is an anomalous case depending- upon the peculiar na~' ture and provisions  f the compact of 1802, between the two states. The statute of limitations of Tennessee could not operate upon these lands until they were ascertained to lie in Tennessee  and the peculiar rule established by the courts of Tennessee,'permitting an equitable title to be asserted in an action at law, would not apply to a controversy concerning titles wholly depending on :he law of Virginia. The proceedings in ejectment are fictitious in form, but for all the purposes of substantial justice they are considered as real. If the term expire pending the action, the court will permit it to he enlarged, and no conveyance by the lessor of the plaintiffs while the suit is going on can operate to extinguish the prior lease. The court below, therefore, committed no error in refusing to perthedeed of conveyance from the plaintiff s lessor to be given in evidence in order-to establish the existence of an outstanding title-. ttmne u right, in S * cannot asserted as a sufficient title than action at ^ssee to Soverlands lying within the dis-g*aedterritory ginia and l/y'the Jgyto w fh in the limits of TpGnocsscc  the titles of Merited hfrorn finia3 by Vir  Feb. 24th.

      "judges:   parties:  Walter Dunn et al., appellants v. Henry Clarke et al. opinions:  Mr Justice M Lean delivered the opinion of the Court. This suit was brought into this court, by an appeal from the decree of the circuit court of the United States, for the district of Ohio. The complainants in the court below filed their bill praying for an injunction to a judgment recovered against them in an action of ejectment, and to obtain a decree for a conveyance of the land in controversy. All the complainants are residents of the state of Ohio, and so are the defendants. The judgment at law was obtained by Graham, a citizen of Virginia, but who has since deceased  and the defendant, Walter Dunn, holds the land recovered, in trust, under the will of Graham. On this state of facts a question is raised, whether this court have jurisdiction of the cause. This question seems not to have been made in the circuit court. No doubt is entertained by the court, that jurisdiction of the case may be sustained, so far as to stay execution on the judgment at law against Dunn. He is the representative of Graham  and although he is a citizen of Ohio, yet this fact, under the circumstapces, will not deprive this court of an equitable control over the judgment. But beyond this, the decree- of this court cannot extend. Of the action at law, the circuit court had jurisdiction  anno change in the residence or condition of the parties can take away a jurisdiction which has once attached. If Graham had lived, the circuit court might have issued an injunction to his judgment at law, without a personal service of process, except on his counsel  and as Dunn is his representative, the court may do the same thing, as against him. The injunction bill is not considered an original bill between the same parties, as at law: but, if other parties are made in the bill, and different interests involved, it must be considered, to that extent at least, an original bill  and the jurisdiction of the circuit court must depend upon the citizenship of the parties. In the present case, several persons are made defendants who were not parties or privies to the suit at law, and no jurisdiction as to them can be exercised, by this or the circuit court. But, as there appear to be matters of equity in the case, which may be investigated by a state court, this court think it would be reasonable and just to stay all proceedings on the judgment, until the complainants shall have time to seek relief from a state court. And the court direct that all proceedings be thus stayed, and that the decree of the circuit court be modified so as to conform to this view of the case. This cause came on to be heard on the transcript of the record from the circuit court of the United States for the district of Ohio, and was argued by counsel  on consideration whereof, it is the opinion of this court, that in the present case several persons are made defendants who were not parties or privies to the suit at law, and that no jurisdiction can be exercised by this or the circuit court  but as there appear to be matters of equity in the case, which may be investigated by a state court, this court think it would be reasonable and just, to stay all proceedings on the judgment until the complainants shall have time to seek relief from a state court, and they so order and decree. And the court further order that the decree of the circuit court be reformed so as to conform to the opinion of this court. attorneys:   corrections:  head_matter: Walter Dunn et al., appellants v.

      "judges:   parties:  James M Donald, Appellant, v. Freeman Smalley, and Others, (in all forty.) opinions:  Mr. Chief Justice Marshall delivered the opinion of the Court.  This suit was instituted in the Circuit Court ojf the.United States for the seventh- Circuit, and district' of Ohio, to obtain a conveyance of a tract of land,' lying in' what is termed   the military. district '    claimed by the complainant under a patent, younger than, that under which it is held by the   defendants. The complainant is a- citizen of Alabama  and. claims the land under a conveyance from Duncan M Arthur, who is a citizen of Ohio. The defendants. objected to the, jurisdiction of the Court  and after Fearing the parties upon this point, the. Court dismissed the bill,   being of. opinion that its jurisdiction'could not be sustained. From this decree, the complainant has appealed, and the cause is-now before this Court on the question of jurisdiction. The bill -states, the complainant to be- a citizen and resident of the state'of Alabama, and the defendants to be citizens and residents of the state- of Ohio. It h s not been' alleged and certainly cannot be alleged, that a citizen of one state, having title to lands in another, is disabled from suing for those lands in the' Courts of the: United States, by-the fact, that he derives-his ti-. tie from a citizen of .the state in which the lands lie : consequently, the single inquiry must be, whether the conveyance from M Arthur to M Donald was real or fictitious ? The transaction, as laid before the Court, appears to be this  M Arthur was apprehensive that his title could not  be sustained ini .the Courts of the state, in. which alone he could sue 'and being indebted tp M Donald in the sum-of 81100, offered to sell and convey to him the land in controversy, in payment of this debt. The .letter in which thijs offer was made, expresses the opinion, that his title was good, and would most probably  be  established in' the Courts-of the United States, but would fail in the Courts of the- state. He estimates the property as-being worth much'more than the sum he- is willing to take for it, but in consequence of the difficulties attending the title, he is willing to convey itin satisfaction of the-debt. fie suggests, that if M Donald should be' disinclined to engage in the controversy himself, he might make an advantageous, sale  to some-of his neighbours, who might be-disposed , to emigrate to Ohio  and' offers to render any service in his power to the proprietor of .the land, in the prosecution of-the claim in the Courts of the - United States. The contract was. concluded by a letter, written in answer to that which has b en statedj of which-the, said M Don ld retained no cop^,. There was no special agreementbetween the plain-tiff and M .Arthur' when the 'deed was written, but perhaps some proposition by letter, fie.gave his bond to a third party for making a quit claim title to the land, on- condition of receiving from him'eiev n hundred dollars. This.-testimony, , which is all that,was laid'before the, Court,   shows, we think,  a sale and conveyance to-th  plaintiff, which was binding on both parties. ' M Donald couild not have maintained an action for his debt, n r M Arthur a suit for his land. His title to it was extinguished, and the Consideration' was received. ' The mptiyes-which induced him' to make the contract,Whether justifiable  r censurable,'can have no influence on-its-validity. They were- such as had sufficient influence with him-s lf, and he' had a right to act upon them.- A . Court cannot enter into them, when' deciding, oh its jurisdiction! The'- con- . veyance app ars to be -a real -transaction,. and -the real as' well as nominal, parties'.to the suit,'are, citizens'of different states.  - '. The only part- of the testimony which can-inspire-doubt, re- . .specting its being  an absolute, s le,  is the admission that the plaintiff gave^ his bond to a\\third party for a quit claim title to the fend, on paying him gllOO.' We  re'not informed who this third'party was, nor 'do we suppose it to'-be material. The |ti(le of M*Arthur-.was vested in the plaintiff, and did. not-pass out of him by this bond.- A' suspicion may exist, that.it was Sor -M Arthur. The Court canndt act-upon-this suspicion,   But -suppose' the fac,t to be avowed,- what influence Could it have upion the. jurisdiction of the Court? It-would-convert the .conveyance, which -on it  face appears .to' be. absolute,, into a mortgage.. But this.-would not.affect the-qu^stion. In a contest 'between the mortgagor tfnd mortgagee, being citizens of different States, it cannot be doubted that an ejectment, or a bill to foreclose, may be brought by the mortgagee, residing in a different state, in a Court of the United States. Why .then may he not sustain a suit in the same Court, against'any other person being a citizen of the same state with the mortgagor. We can perceive ho reason why he should not. The case depends, we think, on the question, whether the transaction between M Arthur and M Donald was real or fictitious  'and we perceive no reason to doubt its reality, whether the deed be considered as absolute or as a mortgage. A question has been made, whether the Circuit Courtought to- have noticed the testimony on the conveyance under which the plaintiff claims, because it was brought irregularly before them. By a- law of the state, interrogatories may be propounded, by the defendant in his answer, which the plaintiff is compelled to answer as if they had been propounded in a cross bill. Although this point has become unimportant in this cause, the Court thinks it proper to say, that the rules Which govern the practice of the Circuit Courts in Chancery, have been prescribed by this Court, and ought to be observed. We think, there is error in the decree of the Circuit Court dismissing the complainar  s bill, and that the same ought to be reversed, and the .cause remanded for further proceedings according to law. This case came on, &c  and was- argued on the point of ju-bn consideration whereof, This Court is of opinion, that there is error' in the decree of the said Circuit Court dismissing the complainant s bill. It is therefore decreed, and ordered by. this Court, that the decree of the said Circuit Court in this caus  be and'the same is hereby reversed and annulled.

Where the record from' the Cburt below, contained the whole proceedings in the case, and exhibited all the matters'either party required for a final   disposition of the case, and the counsel for both the appellant and the ap-pellees, were willing to submit, upon argument, the whole case to the final decision of the Court.  but it appeared that the-Circuit Court of Ohio had not decided any question,- but that which had- been raised upon the jurisdiction of the Court, the counsel were directed by this Court to argue the point of jurisdiction only. {621 } It cannot be alleged, that a citizen of one state, having title to lands in another state, is disabled from suing for thos,e lands in the Courts of the United States, by the fact that he derives his title from a citizen of the state   in which the lands lie. {628} M., a citizen of Ohio, apprehensive his title to lands in that state could not be maintained in the state Court, and being indebted to the plaintiff, a citizen of, Alabama, to the amount'of $1100, offered to sell and convey to him the land, in payment of the debt, stating' in the.letter by which the offer was made, that the .title would most probably .be maintained in the Courts of the United States, but would fail in the Courts of the state. The . property was1 estimated at more than the debt, but in consequence of the difficulties attending the title, he was Willing to .convey it for the debt, which was done. The plairitiff in error, after the land was conveyed to him, gave .his bond to make a'quit claim title-to the land, on condition of receiving $1000.  held that the title acquired by the purchaser, gave jurisdiction to the Courts of the United States. {623} The motives which induced M. to make the contract for the purchase of ' the'land, can have no influence on its validity. A Court cannot enter into the consideration of those motives, when deciding on its jurisdiction. {624} ,   . In a contract between a mortgagor and mortgagee, beihg citizens of different states, it cannot be doubted, that an ejectment, orbillto'foreclose, may be  brought in a Court of the United Statesj by the mortgagee residing in a different state. {624} The rules which govern the practice of the Circuit Courts in Chancery, have   been prescribed by this Courtand ought to be observe'd  {625} THIS was an -appeal, from the Circuit Court of Ohio, by the . complainant in that Court, on a bib filed in the Ch ncery side.of the Court  the object of which was, through the aid of that Court,'tp ofitain a conveyance of   tract of land, situated in the state of Ohio. The complainant, a citizen  f th'e  tate of Alabama,  derived title under a conveyance- from Duncan- M Arthur, a citizen  of Ohio  and the only point decided in the Circuit Court, was upon the question of jurisdiction. The Circuit Court dismissed,the bill,  for-Want of jurisdiction  and the .complainant appealed to this Court.  Before, the argument commenced, the counsel for both parties. asked instructions of. the Court qpon   the question, whether, as the record contained the  whole of the proceedings in the'cause, and exhibited all the matters either party required for .a iifial disposition of the case, in this Court, upon all the-points' in controversy, this' Court would permit the argument to go-to the'whole case, so that a decree could be, given here upon the whole case'  or, whether, an. opinion upon the jurisdiction-only.having been given in''the Circuit Court, the argument should be confined to that question.. The Court having -advised upon the subject', directed the counsel to. argue -the'point of, jurisdiction only, as no other, than that had been . decided' in the Court from which the  appe b had been taken. In the Circuit Court of Ohio, the defendant suggested, that' M Donald, the complainant in the bill, was not a -citizen- of Ohio  and according to a  practice in the.Courts of the state >of Ohio, under the .'authority of a. law', of that state, interro-' gatori s were exhibited to the complainant, to which answers were given. This-law was'passed, subsequent to the Act of -Congress  establishing the judiciary system, and was admitted not to. be authority in the Courts of the United States. The facts, stated', by the cojuplain nt, in answer to those interrogatories, with' other testimony, furnished the ground taken against-the-jurisdiction, of the Court. On the 14th November 1823, Duncan M Arthur conveyed,by .deed of indenture, the' land in controversy, to the complainant  the consideration expressed in the deed being-1100 dollars, the amount of a debt he owed to the complainant, for land purchased' from him. In reply to the interrogatory   whether, he was th ..ben ficial owner,' or was prosecuting the suit for the benefit'qf some resident in-Ohio  and whether .he is the real prosecutor of the suit, and was-so at its Comtnence-rtienf, or whether his name .-was' used for the benefit of a citizen of the state, of Ohio?,  the complainant answered, by: referring .to a letter from Duncan M Arthur to him, dated July 18th 1823. In that' letter, Duncan M Arthur offer's to ' give ..the land in question, 1266 acres, alleged to be'worth five dollars per acre, tp pay a,debt of 1100 dollars  suggests that, the title is goody if prosecuted in the Federal -CoUrt   but state Judges do not understand land   causes, and a claimant in the military district, might as well toss up heads, and tails, as sue in.a state  Court.  It. contains also this suggestion   -should you- accept this offer, and not wi'sh to, prosecute the claim yourself, you can make something handsome, I hav  no doubt, by' selling it to some of your neighboursand it con- . eludes with offering *f any assistance in -my power, shotild a suit be  brought for recovery of the laud in the Circuit Court.  He also stated, in his answer, that the deed under which ' he claimed, was executed for the purpose of giving jurisdiction to the Court of the United States  - because' he believed that Court safer than any Qther in the.state of Ohio  thkt the' contract was made by letter, of which he had not retained a, copy  and, that at the time the deed was  written,  there-whs no special ..agreement between him and M Arthur,'but, perhaps, propositions fay letter.  I give my bonds to a third party for a quit claim title to said lands, on condition of their paying me 1100 dollars.   The complainant insisted, that the deed from M Arthur, conveys to M Donald such a title as will enable him to.sustain the suit id a Federal Court    that it is sufficient, if. he has any interest    .that by accepting the deed, M Donald has been, paid his debt, and though he may be only mortgagee, he may sue in this Court. The-respondents contended,'that the answer of M Donald, shows -that he is' not' the owner of the land  and, his manner bf answering, leaves no doubt, but. that the- owner is a citizen of Ohio, and that the jurisdiction of the Court, therefore, cannot be .maintained.

The engagement to gitse a quit claim deed, coupled with the absen,ce'of proof to show that the deed to be made w.as to-another person than -M Arthur, authorises th  assertion that the whole arrangement was one intended only to aid M Arthur in' bringing his title before a Court of the-United .States  and such a- proceeding-cannot be sustained.\n",

      "judges:   parties:  Den ex dem. Walker v. Turner. opinions:  Mr. Justice Washington delivered the opinion of the Court. This was an ejectment brought in. May, 1818, in the Circuit Court fyr the District, of Tennessee, by the plaintiff-in error, to recover possession of a lot of ground in the town of Nashville, distinguished in the plan of the town,., as lot No. 85. Upon the trial of the cause, the plaintiff gave in evidence, a deed for flit* lot. in controversy, from the commissioners of the toivn of Nashville to the lessor of the plaintiff bearing date the 6th off August, 1790, and then proved the defendant to be in possession of the same at the time the suit was brought. The defendant then gave in evidence a record of the  County.Court , of Davidson, in the State of Tennessee, by which it appears, that upon the complaint of Roger B. Sappington, administrator of- Mark B. Sappington, deceased, to a Justice of the Peace for the said county  supported by,his oath,   that George Walker (the lessor of the plaintiff) was justly indebted to him, as administrator aforesaid, as appears by the books-of the said Mark, to the amount of 20 dollars arid 25 cents, and that the said Walker was an inhabitant of another government, so that the ordinary process of law could hot be served upon him, an attachment, bearing date the 24th of April, 5804, was awarded by the magistrate against the estate of the said Walker, which the officer was, by the said process, directed to, secure, so as.to be liable to further proceedings to, be had before the said Justice, or some other Justice for the said county. The return upon the attachment was, that no personal property was to be found   and on the 26th of April, 1804, judgment was rendered by the magistrate in favour of the plaintiff for 20 dollars and 25 cents, and costs, These proceedings, being carried into the Coun.ty Court of Davidson, the cause was there docketted,. and the defendant having appeared by attorney, a stay of six months, under the law, was. entered on the docket, At. the sessions of the Court, in October, 1804, the defendant entered special bail, and reprieved the property attached. The record then exhibits the following entry, viz.   On which attachment the said administrator nb- . tained judgment before J. A. Parker, [who issued the attachment,] a Justice of. the Peace, on the 26th of April, 1804  which proceedings being brought up. to Dayidson County Court, April sessions, 1804, and a stay of further  proceedings ordered to the present sessions, (October, 1804,), at which sessions bail was entered, in order to replevy the property attached  after which, and during the same sessions, the said Sappington moved the Court for an order to sell the property attached, whereupon the Court directed the .Clerk to issue orders of sale to the Sheriff, to sell the property attached.  The record proceeds to state, that, in pursuance of this judgment, orders of sale issued, returnable to the January sessions of 1805, but which did not appear to have been returned. The defendant then gave in evidence   deed, dated the 22d of July, 1809, from the Sheriff of Davidson county to Roger B. Sappington, for the lot in question, purchased by him at public auction, under process of the Court of said county,. for non-payment of the taxes due upon the said lot. The defendant also gave in evidence, a deed from the, said Roger B. Sappington to Lemuel P. Turner, deceased, to whom the defendant was prdved to be heir and devisee. He further proved, that shortly after the deed by the Sheriff' to. Roger B. Sappington, he (the grantee) exercised acts of ownership on the lot in question, by cutting trees, quarrying stones, &c. which he continued to do until |he sold the lot to Turner, but that he never resided on the lot, or had any continued possession thereof, except as above stated. The next evidence given by the defendant, was a deed, dated the day of January, 1806, from the Sheriff of Davidson county to Roger B. Sap-pington,. which, after reciting all the proceedings before mentioned, before the magistrate of Davidson county, and the Court of that county, in the suit of Sappington against Walker, the, writ of vend. expo, to sell the said lot, issued by the said County Court, and the purchase of the same by the said Sappington, as the highest bidder  at public auction  conveys the said lot to him. The defendant then proved, that in the year 1811 or 1812, Lemuel P. Turner commenced building a stone fence on this lot, which he was one or two years engaged in completing  that he commenced building a. house on the lot,, which he incessantly persevered in till it was finished, after which he removed into it, in 1812 or 1813. Upon the above evidence, set forth in a bill of exceptions to the opinion of the Court, the charge to the jury was, that the deed from the Sheriff of Davidson county to R. B. Sappington, under the judgment of Sappington s. administrator, against Walker,, was sufficient, if the jury.believed the facts to be as above, stated,, to vest the title of said Walker . .to .said lot in Sappington the purchaser at the execution sale  that the tribunal that adjudicated, and from whom to  execution issued, had jurisdiction .of the subject- matter, and that the parties,' too, were in Court.  that the deeds aforesaid were of such a colour or appearance of title as, connected with seyen years peaceable and continued possession, by the persons claiming under them  and the .grant to Walker, would protect the possession under-the statute of limitations. The f ct as to possession was left to the jury  The Judge further stated, that a. pspty, to he.protected by the statute,.-must have an adverse continued possession of the land in dispute, either by actually residing on it, or by having it enclosed with a stone fence, and that a possession, by such enclosing or fence, would be sufficient, without an aetual residence on the land. This charge, presents, for the. consideration of the Court, the following questions: 1. Whether the deed, from the Sheriff of Davidson county to Sappington, did vest in the latter a title, to the land in question ? 2. Whether, under the circumstances stated in the bill of exceptions, the possession of the.defendant was protected by the statute ef limitations of the State of Tennessee ? 3. Whether the Court below was right in the statement made to the jury, as to what, constitutes a possession to be protected by the act of limitations. 1. Whether the Sheriff s deed conveyed to' Sappingtoft a title to the land in controversy, depends upon the Question, whether the sale was madq under the judgment of a tribunal having jurisdiction of the cause in which it was rendered. The judgment was rendered by a Justice of the Peace, upon an attachment issued by him against   non-resident, and returnable before himself  and the order for selling th  property attached, was made by the County Court, ,It does not, however, appear by the return made upon the attachment, that the lot in dispute, or any other property of Walker, was attached   nor does it even appear, otherwise  than by a recital in the deed from the Sheriff to Sappington, that any process issued from the County Court, which' authorized the Sheriff to sell this lot. Evidence , was given by the Clerk, that an execution issued, corresponding with the order of the Court, but that the exer cution could not be found. If the execution corresponded with the order of the Court, then it authorized the sale of the property attached   and as the return of the constable does not state that any property was attached, it is difficult to perceive by what authority the lot in dispute was sold to Sappington. As to the recital in the deed from the Sheriff to Sappington, that the wrjt of vend  tioni exponas, under which, the sale was made, authorized the sale of this lot, it is inadmissible as evidence of that fact against the plaintiff, who was neither a party noi  privy to the deed. But passing by this objection to the validity of the sale, the Court will inquire, whether the same was sanctioned by the judgment of a tribunal having competent jurisdiction of the case in which it was rendered. It is, in the first place, by no means tobe admitted, that at the time these proceedings were instituted, a Justice of the Peace was authorized, by the laws of Tennessee, to issue an attachment against the estate of a non-resident debt- or, returnable before himself, and determinable by him. By the 19th, 20th, and 21st sections of. the act of 1794, a Justice of the Peace is empowered to issue an attachment, against the estate of a debtor who has removed, or is removing himself privately out of. the county, or who so absconds and conceals himself, that the ordinary process of law cannot be served upon him   and  lso, against the estate of a non-resident  but in all these cases, the attachment is to be returned to the Court where the suit is cognizable, and is to be there adjudicated. This attachment may be levied on the lands, goods, and chattels of the debtor. By the 56th section of this act, the magistrate is authorized, in cases where by the said act he has jurisdiction, to ,issue an attachment, against the estate of an absconding or absent debt- or   and the proceedings thereon, before him, are to be in a summary way, as on a warrant. The Court does not understand that this section extends to persons who are citizens and residents without the limits of Tennessee. It may well be doubted, then, whether the proceedings before the Justice were not, on this ground, coram non judice. But without giving a positive decision upon that point, the Court is of opinion, that the Justice had not jurisdiction of the subject matter, upon which his judgment was rendered. By the 52d section of the above act, jurisdiction is given to any Justice of the Peace, in cases of d bts and demands amounting to twenty dollars and under, where the balance is due on any specialty, note, or agreement, for money or specific articles,, or for goods, wares and merchandise, sold and delivered, or work and labour done  in which cases he is empowered to'render judgment, and to award execution against the goods and chattels, or the body of the debtor. It is admitted by the counsel, that a subsequent law raised the jurisdiction of the Justice beyond the sum for which this judgment was rendered. By the act of 1786, which we understand is still, in force in Tennessee, it is provided, that when an execution is in the hands of a constable, in consequence of a judgment of a Justice of the Peace, and there, shall be no personal property whereon to levy it, in such case he shall levy it on the real estate of the defendant, and make return thereof to the next County Court, that the Court may order the Sheriff to sell the said real estate, or enougli ther'eof, according to law. Whether it was under this act, that the proceedings before the magistrate found their way into the County . Court, it is impossible for this Court to decide.. It doris not se m to us, that the case is one which was provided for by that act, since it docs not appear that any execution was issued by the magistrate, upon his own judgment  or if any did issue, that it was levied on the real estate of the debtor, and returned to the County Court. Be all this as it may, the ground o   the jurisdiction of the magistrate does not appear upon the face of the proceedings before him   without which, the Court must consider them as coram nonjudic . The cases of which he had cognizance, are-particularly enumerated in the f>2d section, before recited   and it appears, by the record given in evidence, that the demand sworn to by Sappington, was for 20 dollars and 25 cents, as appeared by the books of his intestate. But this was not the assertion of a cause of action, for   a balance due on any specialty, note or agreement, for money or specific articles, or for goods, wares and merchandise sold arid delivered, or for work and labour done.  It might have been for rent due, for money advanced, money received to the use of the plaintiff, and even for money claimed by the plaintiff as due ex debito, and charged in the books of the intestate. It is obvious, that the magistrate had no authority to take cognizance of these cases, and of others, which might be stated  and since his jurisdiction was strictly special and limited, it is essential to the validity of his judgment, and of the proceedings under it, that the record should show that he acted upon a ca.se which the law submitted t  his jurisdiction. The order of the County Court, for the sale of the defendant s land, having been founded upon this judgment} is exposed .to the same objection which applies to the judgment itself. If the judgment was void, an execution, or order of sale, founded upon it, was equally so. This Court must,- th refore, decide-, that the deed from the Sheriff to Sappington, under whom the defendant claims, was utterly void, having been made without any legal authority. 2. The next question is, whether,  nder the circumstances stated in the , bilL of exceptions, the possession of the defendant was protected by the statute of limitations of the State of Tennessee ? This statute, which passed iri the yepr 1797, enacts,   that in all cases wherever any person or -persons shall have had seven years peaceable possession of any land, by virtue of.a grant, or deed of conveyance, founded upon a grant, and no legal claim, by suit in law be set up to said land, within the above said term, that then, and in that case, the person, &c. &c. holding possession as aforesaid, shall be entitled to hold, possession, iri preference to all other claimants, of such quantity of land as shall be specified in his, her, or their said grant. or deed of conveyance, founded on a grant as aforesaid-  In the case of Patton's lessee v. Easton, (1 Wheat. Rep. 476.) a construction of the above act was given by this Court, in which it was decided, that a possession of seven years is a bar, only when it is held under a grant, or under, a deed founded on a grant  and that, as the defendant, in that case, showed no title under the trustees of the town of Nashville,.nor under any other grant, his seven years possession was insufficient to protect his title, or to bar that of the plaintiff, under a conveyance from the trustees. That was a stronger case for the defendant than the present  for in that the defendant gave in evidence a deed, for a valuable consideration, from Josiah Love to William T Lewis, at a time when the possession of the lane in controversy was vacant. That Lewis, immediately after the conveyance, took possession of the land, made valuable improvements thereon, and continued so possessed for about seventeen years, when he sold and conveyed the same to the defendant, who took and continued the possession until the ejectment was brought. Here, then, was an entry upon land in. the actual possession of no person, under a bona fide deed, and -a long continued possession under that title, which could not avail the defendant, because he could not trace a connected title up to a grant. In the present case, it appears, from the defendant s own showing, that Sappington, under whom he claims, had no title. If the defendant claims under a grant, or under mesae conveyances, which connect him with a grant, he gains a preference, by seven years possession, over all other claimants, however superior their title may be to his, independent of such possession. But this possession is of no value to him, unless he. can show such a title as is above described. The case of Harris and Holmes v. Bledsoe s lessee, decided by the Supreme Court of Errors and Appeals of the State of Tennessee, in January, 1821, of which a manuscript report was handed to the Court, seems in principle to be undistinguishable from the present, except that in that, the defendant connected himself with a grant  if the state of the case, which is very imperfectly set forth, in the opinion of one of the Judges, is rightly understood by this Court. But the infirmity of the defendant s title lay in one of the links of the chain, which was that of a deed from executors who had no power to sell and convey by the law, nor was it given by the will of the testator. Even a deed of confirmation, which was executed with a view to cure this defect in the title, was unavailing,   because,  to use the language of one of the Judges,   the act to be confirmed was void.  In the case before the Court, the defect in the defendant s chain of title, is the want of authority in the Sheriff to convey to Sappington, which rendered his deed absolutely void. The Court is, therefore, of opinion, that the Court below erred in stating to the jury that the deed to-Sappington, under the judgment of Sap-pington s administrator against Walker, was sufficient to vest the title of Walker in Sappington  and that the deeds referred to were of such a co-lour or appearance of title as, connected with seven years peaceable and continued possession, by the persons claiming under them, and the grant to Walker,. would- protect the possessor under the statute of limitations. It is deemed unnecessary to notice the third point, because, if the charge requires of a defendant more, than the law does, to entitle, him to the benefit of the seven years possession, it'is so far favourable to the plaintiff in error. It certainly does hot require of him less. . Neither does the Court notice the Sheriff s deed to Sappington for the lot in controversy, purchased by him at public auction, under process of the County Court, for non-payment of taxes, as that subject was not noticed by the.Judge, in his charge to the jury, and it can, therefore, present no question for the consideration Of this Court. Judgment reversed, and a venire facias de novo awarded. Judgment. This cause came on to be heard, &c.

      "judges:   parties:  Thomas Willison, Plaintiff in Error vs. Anderson Watkins, Defendant in Error. opinions:  Mr Justice Baldwin delivered the. Opinion of the Court. This w s an action of trespass tqtry titles, brought in. 1822, in the circuit court of the' United States for the district of South Carolina, by Watkins against Willison* for a. tract of land containing six hundred acres, on the Savannah river. This land was originally granted to James Parsons, who conveyed to Ralph Phillips, .whose estate was confiscated by an act of assembly of South Carolina, and vested in five commissioners appointed by the legislature of that  tate. The five commissioners acted in execution of the'law, but before, any conveyance was made of . the land in question, one of them had died, and two of the others had ceased to,act,-or resigned. in 1783. The' two remaining commissioners, in 1788, conveyed -this land to' Daniel Bordeaux and R, Newman, who in the same year executed to the treasurer of the state, a bond and mortgage to secure the payment, of the purchase money, .which, pursuant to an act of assembly passed for that purpose in 1801, Was transferred and delivered to Ralph S. Phillips, the son of Ralph Phillips, to be disposed of as he should think proper  and by the same law the confiscation act, so far as respected Ralph Phillips, was repealed. A suit was brought on this bond in the name of the treasurer of the state in 1803, against Daniel Bordeaux, and prosecuted to final judgment against his administrators in 1817, when an execution issued, on which the land was sold and conveyed by deed, from the sheriff to Anderson Watkins, the plaintiff in the circuit court, who claims by virtue of the sheriffs deed, and as standing in the relation of landlord to the defendant. Samuel Willison, the father of the defendant, entered into possession of the premises in question in 1789, and cultivated them till his death in 1802  from which time his widow and children possessed them, till her death in 1815  since which time the children have retained possession by their tenants, till the commencement of this suit. In 1802, Ralph S. Phillips, who was then the assignee of the bond and mortgage, made a demand of the possession from the widow, who refused to give it up, and set up a title in herself. He brought an action of trespass against her to try titles in January 1803, in which he was nonsuited in November 1805  and in March 1808 he brought another action of the same nature against her, in which no proceedings were had after 1812, which, by the law and practice of South Carolina, operates as a discontinuance of the action. In 1792 Bordeaux, the mortgagor, executed to Willison a power of attorney authorising him to take possession of the land, and sue trespassers. Willison was then a tenant of Bordeaux. In 1793 they were in treaty for the sale of the land  Bordeaux wanting to sell, and Willison to purchase. But during the life time of Willison, Bordeaux was apprised that he claimed to' hold the land by an adverse title. The defendant exhibited no title other than what is derived from the possession of his father and the family. The first question which arose at the trial, was on the admission in evidence of the deed from the two commissioners to Bordeaux and Newman  the defendant alleging, that no title passed by it, because it was not signed by the other two commissioners. The circuit court overruled the objection   the deed was read, and this becomes the subject of the first error assigned in this court. As the court have been unable to procure the confiscation act of South Carolina, we are unwilling to express any opinion on this exception without examining its provisions, which are very imperfectly set out in the record  and as the merits.of the case can be decided on another exception, we do not think it necessary to postpone our judgment. The remaining exception is, that the circuit court erred in charging the jury, that the claim of the-plaintiff was not barred by the act of limitations of South Carolina, which protects a possession of fiv  years from an adverse title. It appears from the record, that the defendant and his family have been in possession of this land 'for thirty-three years next before this suit was brought  but whether that possession has beep adverse to the title of the. plaintiff during the whole of that time, or s ch part Of it as will bring him within the protection of this law, becomes a very important inquiry. The plaintiff contended, at the trial, that, by becoming the tenant of Bordeaux, Willison the elder and his heirs, so long as they remain in possession, are prevented from setting up any title in themselves, or denying that of Bordeaux  without first surrendering to him the possession, and: then, bringing their suit. That the possession of the tenant being the possession of the landlord, he' could do no act by which it could become adverse,-so that the statute of limitations would begin to run in his favour, or operate to bar his claim, by any lapse of time, however long. The defendant, on the other hand, contended, that from the tipie of the disclaimer of the tenancy by Willison, and the setting up of a title adverse to Bordeaux and with his knowledge, his possession became adverse, and that he co  d avail himself of the act of limitations if no suit Was brought within five years thereafter. It is an undoubted, principle of law fully recognised by this court, that a tenant cannot dispute the title of his landlord, either-by setting up a title in himself, or a third person^ during the existence of the lease or.tenancy,. The principle of estoppel applies to the relation between them, and operates in its full force to prevent the tenant from violating that contract bv which he obtained and holds possession. 7 Wheat. 535. He cannot change ,the character of, the tenure by his own act merely, so as to enable himself to hold against his landlord',. who reposes under the security of the tenancy, believing thepossession of the tenant to be his own, held under his title, and ready to be surrendered by its termination, by the lapse of time, or demand of possession. The same principle applies to mortgagor and mortgagee, trustee and cestui que trust, and generally to all cases where, one man obtains possession of real estate belonging to another, by a recognition of his title. On all these subjects the law is too well settled to require illustration or reasoning, or to admit of a doubt. Rut we do not think, that in any of these relations, it has been adopted to the extent contended for in this case, which presents a disclaimer by a tenant with the knowledge of his landlord, and an unbroken possession afterwards for s eh a length of time that the act of limitations has run out four tithes before he has done any act to assert his right to the land. New stronger cases than this can occur, and if the plaintiff can recover without any other evidence of title than a tenancy existing thirty years before suit brought, it must be conceded that no length of time, no disclaimer of tenancy-by the tenant, and no implied acquiescence of the landlord  can protect a possession originally acquired under such a tenure. If there is any case which could clearly illustrate the sound policy of acts of repose and quieting titles and possessions by the limitation of actions, it is in this.  Here was no secret disclaimer, no undiscovered fraud  it was'known to Bordeaux, and was notice to him that Willison meant to hold from that time by his. owp title and on adverse possession.- This terminated the tenancy as to him, and from that time Bordeaux had a right to eject him as a trespasser. Adams on Eject. 118. Bull. N. P. 96. 6 Johns. Rep. 272. Had there been a formal lease for   term not then expired  the lessee forfeited it by this act of hostility  had it been, a lease at will from year to year, he was entitled to no notice to quit before an ejectment. The landlord s action would be as against a trespasser  as much so as if no relation- had ever-existed between them. Having thus a right to consider the lessee as. a wrong doer, holding adversely, we think that under the circumstances pf this case the lessor was bound so to do. It would be an anomalous possession, which as to the rights of one party was adverse, and as to the other fiduciary, if after a disclaimer with' the knowledge of the landlord, and attornment to a third person, or setting up a-title in himself, the tenant, forfeits his possession and all the benefits of the lease he ought to be en ' titled to, such as result from his known adverse possession. No injury can be done the landlonTunless by his own laches. If he sues within the period of the act of limitations he must recover: if he suffers the time to pass without suit, it is but the common case of any other party who loses his right by negligence and loss of time. As to the assertion of his claim, the possession is as adverse and as open to his action, as one. acquired originally by wrong  and we cannot assent do the proposition that the possession shall assume such character as one party alone may choose to give it. The act is conclusive on the tenant. He cannot make his disclaimer and adverse claim, so as to protect himself during the un xpired term of the lease : he is a trespasser on him who has the legal title. The relation of landlord and tenant is dissolved, and-each party is to stand upon his right. It is on this principle alone that the plaintiff could claim to recover in this action. If there was between him and the defendant an existing tenancy at the time it was brought, he had no right of entry . The lessee cannot be a trespasser during the existence of the lease, and cannot be turned out till its termination. At the end of a definite term the lessor has his election to consider the lessee a trespasser and to enter on him by ejectment  but if he suffers him to remain in possession, he becomes a tenant at will, or from year to year, and in either case is entitled to a notice to quit before the lessor can eject him. The notice terminates the term, and thenceforth the lessee is a wrongdoer and holds at his peril. Woodfall s Land. & Ten. 218, 220. 2 Serg. & Rawle, 49. If the tenant disclaims the tenure, claims the fee adversely in right of a third person or his own, or attorns to another, his possession then becomes a tortious one, by the forfeiture of his right. The .landlord s right of entry is complete, and he may sue at any time within the period of limitation  but he must lay his demise  f a day subsequent to the termination of the tenancy, for before that he had no right of entry. By bringing, his ejectment, he also affirms the tenancy and goes for theTorfeiture. It shall not be permitted to the landlord to thus admit that there is' no tenure- subsisting between him and defendant which can protect his. possession from his adversary suit, and at the same time recover on. the ground of there being a tenure so strong that he cannot set up his own adversary possession. . The plaintiff claims without showing any title in himself, pr any right of possession, except what exists from the consequences of a tenancy, the existence pf which he denies in the most solemn manner, by asserting its termination before suit brought. The principle here asserted i$ not new in this court. In the case of Blight s lessee vs. Rochester, 7 Wheat, 535, 549, the plaintiff s, lessors, claimed as heirs of John Dunlap: the defendant claimed by purchase from one Hunter, who professed to have purchased from Dunlap.' The defendant acknowledged the title of Dunlap as the one under which he held. Dunlap had in fact no title  but the plaintiffs insisted that the defendant could not deny his title. The Chief Justice, iff giving the opinion of the court,, observes: If he holds under an adversary title to Dunlap, his right to contest his title is admitted. . If he claims under a sale from Dunlap, and Dunlap himself is compelled to aver that he does, then the plaintiffs themselves assert a title against this contract. Unless they, show that it'was conditional and that the condition is broken, they cannot, in the very act of dis egarding it themselves, insist that it binds the defendant in good faith to acknowledge a title which has no real existence. We . are not aware that in applying this doctrine to the case now before the court we shall violate any-settled principle of the common law. If a different rule was established, the consequences Would be very serious. A mortgagee, a direct purchaser from a tenant, or one who buys his right at a sheriff s sale, assumes His relations to the landlord with all their legal consequences, and they are as much estopped from denying the tenancy. If no length of time would protect a possession originally , acquired under a,lease, it would be productive of evils truly alarming, and we must be convinced beyond a doubt that the law is so settled before we could give our sanction to such a doctrine. An examination of the authorities on this point relieves our minds from all such apprehensions, by finding.our opinion supported t  its full .extent bv judicial decisions entitled to the highest respect, and which we may safely adopt as evidence of the common law. The case Of'Hovenden vs. Lord Annesley was that of a tenant who had attorned to One claiming adversely to his lessor with his knowledge. Ip delivering his opinion, Lord Redesdale entered into a detailed view of the decisions on the application of the act of limitations to trusts of real and personal estate in courts of law and chancery, and to fiducial/ possessions generally. On the point directly before us he observes :  That the attornment will not affect the title of the lessor so long as he has a fight to consider the person holding possession as his tenant. But as he has a right to punish the acts of his tenant in disavowing the tenure by proceeding to eject him, notwithstanding his lease  if he will not proceed for the forfeiture, he has no right to affect the rights of third persons on the ground that the possession was destroyed, and there must pe a limitation to this as well as every other demand. The intention of the act of limitations being to quiet the possession of lands, it would be curious if a tenant for ninety-nine years, attorning to a person insisting he was entir tied, and disavowing tenure to the knowledge of his former landlord, should protect the title of the original lessor for the term of ninety-nine years. That would, I think, be too strong to hold on the ground of- the possession being in the lessor, after the tenure had been disavowed to the knowledge of the lessor.  The relation between tenants in common 'is, in principle, very similar to that between lessor and lessee: the possession of orie is the possession of the other, while ever the tenure is acknowledged.. Cowp. 217. But if one ousts the other, or denies the tenure, and receives the rents and profits to his exclusive use,- his possession becomes adverse, and the act of limitations begins, to run. 2 Scho. & Lef. 628, &c. and cases cited. 4 Serg. & Rawle  570. The possession of .a trustee is the possession of the' cestui que trust, so long as the trust isacknowledged  but from the time of known disavowal it becomes adverse. So of a mortgagee, while, he admits himself to be in-as mortgagee, and therefore liable to redemption. 7 Johns. Cha. 114, &c. and cases cited. But if the right of redemption is-not foreclosed within twenty years, the statute may be pleaded  and so in every case of an equitable title, not being the case of a trustee, whose possession is consistent with the title of the claimant. 7 Johns. Cha. 122. After elaborately revievving-'the English decisions on these and other analogous subjects, chancellor Kent remarks, it is easy to perceive that the doctrines here laid down are the same that govern courts of law. in- analogous case.s, and the statute of limitations receives the same construction and application at law and in equity. Kane vs. Bloodgood, 7 Johns. Cha. 90, 122. It is equally said that fraud as well as trust are not within the statute, and it is well settled that the statute does not run until the discovery of the fraud  for the title to avoid it does not arise until then  and pending the concealment of it, the statute ought not to run. But after the discovery of the fact imputed as fraud, the statute runs as in other cakes  and he cites in support of this position, 1 Browne s Parliament. Cases, 455. 3 P. Wms, 143. 2 Scho. & Lef. 607, 628, 636, and the cases cited. In the case of Hughes vs. Edwards, 9 Wheat. 490, 497, it was settled, that the right of a nortgagor to redeem is barred after twenty years possession by the mortgagee after-forfeiture, no interest having been paid in the mean time, and no circumstance appearing to account for the neglect. 7 Johns. Cha. 122. 2 Sch. & Lef. 636. The court in that-case say, that in respect to the mortgagee, who is seeking to foreclose the equity of redemption, the general rul  is, that where the mortgagor has' been permitted to remain in possession, the mortgage will, after a length of time, be presumed to have been discharged by payment of the money or a release, unless circumstances can be shown sufficiently strong to repel' the presumption  as payment of interest, a promise to-pay, an acknowledgement by the mortgagor that the mortgage is still existing, or the like. All these principles bear directly on the case now before us, they are well settled and unquestioned rules in  ll courts of law and equity, and necessarily lead to the same, conclusion'to which this Gourt lias arrived. The relations created by a lease are not more sacred than those of a trust or a mortgage. By setting up or attorning to a title adverse to his landlord,, the tehant commits a fraud as much as by the breach of any other trust. Why then should not the statute protect him, as well as any other fraudulent trustee, from the time the fraud is discovered or known to the landlord 9 If he suffers the tenant to retain possession twenty years after a tenancy is disavowed, and cannot account for his delay in bringing his suit  why should he be exempted from the operation .of the statute more than the mortgagor or the mortgagee 9 We can perceive no good reasons for allowing. this peculiar and exclusive privilege to a lessor  we can find no rule of law or equity which makes it a matter of duty to do it, and have no hesitation in deciding that in this case the statute of limitations is a bar to the plaintiff s action. In doing this we do not intend to dispute the principle of any case adjudged by the supreme court of South Carolina. Of those which have been cited in the argument there are .n<?ne which in our opinion controvert any of the principles here laid down, or profess to be founded on any local usage, common law, or construction of the statute of limitations of that state. One has been much pressed upon  s, as establishing a doctrine which-woiild support the position of the plaintiff, which deserves some notice. In the case in 1 Nott & M Cord, 374, the court decide, that where a defendant enters under a plaintiff, he shall not dispute his title while he remains in possession, and that he must first give up his possession, and bring his suit to try titles. To the correctness of this principle, we yield our assent, not as one professing to be peculiar to South Carolina, , but as a rule of the common law applicable to the cases of fiduciary possession before noticed. It' is laid down as a general rule, embracing in terms tenants in common, trustees, mortgagees and lessees, but disallowing none of the exceptions or limitations Which qualify it and exclude from its operation all cases where the possession has become adverse, where the party'entitled to it does not filter or sue within the time of the statute of limitations, Or givf any good reason for his delay  leaving the rule in full force wherever the suit is brought within the time prescribed by law. To this extent, and this Only, the decision would reach. To carry it further would be giving a more universal application than the courts of South Carolina would seem to have intended, and further than w  should be warranted by the rules of law. To extend it to cases of vendor and vendee would be iii direct contradiction to the solemn decision in 7 Wheat. 525. In relation to the limitation of actions for the recovery of r al property, we think it proper to apply the remarks of the learned judge who delivered the opinion of this court in the case of Bell vs. Morrison, 1 Peters, 351, and to say that the statute ought to receive, such a construction as will effectuate the beneficent obje ts which it intended to accomplish,   the security of titles, and the quieting of possessions. That which has been- given to it in the present case is we think favourable to its tr,ue spirit and intention  without impairing any legal principle heretofore established. It Is therefore the opinion of the court that the plaintiff in error has sustained his fourth exception, and that the judgment of the circuit.court must be reversed. The cause is remanded to the circuit .court with directions to award a venire de novo. Mr Justice Johnson. Had I felt myself at liberty in the court below, to act upon my own impressions as to the. general doctrine respecting the defence which a tenant might legally set up in ejectment brought against him. by bis landlord, I-certainly should have left it to the jury to inquire  Whether the possession of Willison ever was hostile to that of Bordeaux  a fact, the evidence to prove which was very trifling, , as appears even in this bill of exceptions. But there were produced to me official reports of adjudged cases in that state, by the courts of the last resort, which appeared fully to establish that when once a tenancy was proved, the tenant could make no defence, but must restore possession, and then alone could he avail himself of a title derived from any source whatever, inconsistent with the relation of tenant. Now it ought not to be controverted, that, as to what are the laws of real estate in the respective states, the decisions of every Qther state in the union, or in the universe, are worth nothing against the decisions of the state where the land lies. On such a subject we have just as much right to repeal their statutes as to overrule their decisions. I will repeat a few extracts froth one of their decisions to show, that they will at least afford an apology for the opinion expressed in the bill of exceptions upon the law of South Carolina  for I placed it expressly on their-decisions, not my own ideas of the general doctrine. The case of Wilson vs. Weatherby, 1 Nott & M Cord s Rep. 373, was an action to try title, just such as the present, and heard before Cheves, Justice, in July 1815. The defendant offered to go into evidence to show a title in himself, to which it was objected, that as he had gone into possession under the plaintiff, he could not dispute-his title. Thepbj ction was sustained, and   verdict given for the plaintiff. The cause was then carried up to the appellate court, and the judgment below sustained, that court unanimously agreeing the law to be as laid down by the judge who delivered the opinion, in these terms:   The evidence offered by. the defendant was of a title acquired by him after he went into possession under the plaintiff, and before he gave up possession. If he was at any timelhe tenant of the plaintiff, he continues so all the timo, unless he had given up the possession.- The attempt to evade the rule of law by going out of possession a moment, and then returning into possession, did hot change his situation at all, and especially as he left another person in possession, so that his possession was altogether unbroken. A- distinct and bona fide abandonment of the possession at least was necessary to have put him in a situation to dispute the plaintiffs title. On the last ground, that the defendant was not at any time the tenant of the plaintiff, the defendant was not indeed a tenant under a lease rendering rent, but he nevertheless held under the plaintiff. This ground is founded on a misconception of the principle, which is not confined to the cases of tenants in the common acceptation of- the term. These cases have only furnished examples of the application of the principle, which is,' that wherever a defendant has entered into possession under the plaintiff, he shall not be permitted, while he remains in possession, to dispute the plaintiff s title. He has a right to purchase any title he pleases, but he is bound, bona fide, to give up possession, and to bring his action on his title, and recover by the strength of his own title.  This is the leading case upon this doctrine in that state, and it is fully settled there, that the wif , the executpr, the heir or the purchaser at sheriff s sale, is identified in interest with the previous possessor  as also that a statutory title is acquired by possession, under which one subsequently going out of possession, may recover. Understanding such to be the law of that state, I certainly did not hold myself bound or at liberty to inquire whether it accorded with the rules of decision in any other state. In principle, I am under the impression there is not much difference, or at least not more than that court was at large to disregard if they thought proper. This cause came on to be' heard on the transcript of the record from the circuit court of the United. States for the district of South Carolina, and was argued by counsel  on consideration whereof, it is ordered and adjudged by this court, that the judgment of the said circuit court in this cause be, and the same is hereby reversed, and that this cause be, and the same is hei'eby remanded to the said circuit court, with directions to award a venire facias de novo. attorneys:   corrections:  head_matter: Thomas Willison, Plaintiff in Error vs. Anderson Watkins, Defendant in Error. It is an undoubted principle of law, fully recognized by this court, that a tenant cannot dispute the title of his landlord, either by setting up a title in himself or a third person, during the existence of the lease or tenancy. The principle of estoppel applies to the relation between them, and operates with full force to prevent the tenant from violating that contract by which he claimed and held the possession. He cannot change the character of the tenure by his own act merely, so as to enable himself to hold against his landlord, who reposes under the security of the tenancy, believing .the possession of the t nant to be his own', held under his title, and ready to be surrendered by its termination, by the lapse of time or demand of possession. [47] The same principle applies to mortgagor and mortgagee, trustee and .cestui que trust, and generally to all cases where one man obtains possession of real estate belonging to another by a recognition of his title. [48] In no instance has-the .principle of law which protects the relations between landlord and tenant, been carried so far as in this case, which presents a disclaimer by a tenant with the knowledge of his landlord, and an unbroken possession afterwards for such a length of time, that the act of limitalions has run out four times before he has done any act to assert his right to the land. [48] When a tenant disclaims to hold under his lease, he becomes a trespasser, and his possession is adverse, and as open to the action of his landlord as a possession acquired originally by wrong. The act is conclusive on the tenant. He cannot revoke his disclaimer and adverse claim, so as to protect himself during the unexpired time of the lease. He is a trespasser on him who has the legal title. The relation of landlord and tenant is dissolved, and each party is to stand upon his right. [49] If the tenant disclaims the tenure, claims the fee adversely in right of a third person or in his own right, or attorns to another, his possession then becomes a tortious one, by the forfeiture of his right, and the landlord s right of entry is complete, and he may sue at any time within the period of limitation  but he mu3t lay his'demise of a day subsequent to the termination of the tenancy, for before that he had no right of entry. By bringing his ejectment he disclaims the tenancy and goes for the forfeiture. It shall not be permitted to the landlord to thus admit that there is no tenure subsisting between him and the-tenant which can protect his possession from this adversary suit  and at the same time recover on the ground of there being a tenure so strong as that he cannot set up his adversary possession. [49] A. mortgagee, or direct purchaser from a tenant, or one who buys his right at a sheriff s sale, assumes his relation to thejandlord, with all its legal consequences, and is as much estopped from denying the tenancy. [50] If no length of time would protect a possession originally acquired under a lease, it would be productive of evils truly alarming, and we must be convinced beyond a doubt that the law is so settled, before we would give our sanction to-such a doctrine  and this is ndt the case upon authorities. [51] The relation between tenants in common is in principle'very similar to that between lessor and lessee. The possession of onb is' the possession of the other, while ever the tenure is Acknowledged. But if one ousts the other, or denies the tenure, and receives the rents and profits to his exclusive use, his possession becomes adverse, and the act of limitations begins to run  so of a trustee, so of a-mortgagee. [51] In relation to the limitations of actions for the recovery of real property, the court think it proper to apply the remarks of the learned judge who delivered the 'opinion of the court in the case of Bell vs. Morrison, 1 Peters, 360, and to say, the statute ought to receive such a construction as will effectuate the beneficent objects which it intended to accomplish, the Security of titles and the quieting of' possessions. That which has been given to it in the present case is, we think, conformable to its true spirit and intention, without impairing any principle heretofore established. [54] ERROR to the circuit court of the district of South Carolina. An action of trespass fo try titles was brought in the circuit court of South Carolina, on the 20th of April 1822, by the defendant in error, against the plaintiff in this court, for the recovery of six hundred acres of land situated on the Savannah river. The title claimed by the plaintiff below and the evidence are fully stated in the opinion of the court. Oh the trial in the circuit court the defendant proved that Samuel Willison, his father, had possession of the land in 1789, and cultivated it till the period of his death in 1802, from which time.his widow and family possessed it until the death of his widow in 1815  and that from 1815. until this action was brought, the children retained possession by. their tenants. That in the lifetime of Samuel Willison, Bordeaux, through whom the plaintiff, claimed, was apprised that he claimed to hold the land by an adverse title. That the widow in 1802, on demand made, refused to give possession to Ralph S. Phillips who claimed the lanth-and set up a' title in herself, and was sued as a trespasser. That in 1793, Borde ux and Willison were in treaty for the sale of this land  Bordeaux wishing to sell, and Willison to purchase. The plaintiff then offered in evidence a power of attorney from Bordeaux to Willison, dated February 1792, authorising him to take possession of the land, and sue trespassers   and that Willison was then a'tenant of Bordeaux. The defendant having pleaded the statute of limitations (five years adverse possession giving a title under it) relied upon the foregoing facts. But the presiding jjidge overruled the plea, and instructed the jury that, when a tenancy had been preyed to have once existed, the tenancy must hot only be abandoned, but possession given up, before an adverse possession can fee alleged. To this decision the defendant excepted. The defendant brought this writ of error. In the argument of the cause, the courisel for the plaintiff in error presented for the consideration of the court other exceptions besides that upon which the judgment of the circuit court was reversed. The decision of the court is exclusively upon the law arising on that which is stated. The case was argued by Mr Blanding and Mr M Duffie for the plaintiff in error, and by Mr Berrien, attorney gene-, ral, for the defendant.\n",

      "judges:   parties:  John F. Games and Nathan Gilbert, Plaintiffs in error, vs. John Stiles, ex dem. of Walter Dunn, deceased, Defendant in error. opinions:  Mr. Justice M'Lean delivered the opinion of the Court. This .case is brought before this Court .from the Circuit Court of Ohio, by a writ of error. An action of ejectment was brought by Dunn against the defendants, in the Circuit Court, for the recovery of a certain tract of land  and on the trial, exceptions were taken to the rulings of the Court,' which being the points decided before this Court. The first objection taken was, that the deed offered in evidence by'the plaintiff from David Carrick Buchanan to Walter Sterling, recited the proceedings and decree of a Court of the United States, for the. fifth circuit, and Virginia district, &c., and no exemplification .of the record of such proceedings and decree was offered' in evidence, in support of. the deed. Buchanan was the patentee of the land  and although he made the conveyance in   pursuance of the decree, yet as the. fee was in him, the decree could add nothing to the validity of the conveyance  and it was, therefore, wholly unnecessary to prove it. The deed was good without, the decree, and was only referred to by the grantor to show the consideration, in part, for making it. The defendant also objected to th  admission of the deed in evidence, because   it was not duly acknowledged, and proved, according to law  there being no proof of the delivery, either in the acknowledgment or other proof  except what appears on the deed, and that it was in possession of the lessor of the plaintiff.  This deed was executed at Glasgow, in Scotland, and' its execution was proved by the two subscribing witnesses, who swore,  that they saw the said grantor seal as his own proper act and deed, in due form of law, acknowledge and deliver this present' conveyance.  This oath was administered by the Lord Provost, and chief magistrate of' Glasgow, and which he duly certified, under his seal of office. The objection did not go to the execution of the deed, but to the want of proof of the delivery. In the conclusion of the deed, it is stated to have been signed, sealed  and delivered in presence of the subscribing witnesses, and they swear that it was delivered. But, independently of these facts, the possession of the deed by the lessor of the plaintiff, who offers it ip proof, is prima facie evidence of its delivery. Under ordinary circumstances, no' other evidence of the delivery of a deed, than the possession of it by the person claiming under it, is required. The defendant also objected to this deed, that it did not. appear that the grantor, David Carrick Buchanan, was the same person named as grantee in .the patent, who is called David Buchanan. In the d ed, the grantor declares, that   I, David Carrick Bucharnan, formerly David Buchanan,  &c. And in connection with this objection the Court were asked to charge the jury,   that it is necessary for the plaintiff to convince them by proofs in Court, that David Carrick Buchanan is the same person as David Buchanan, named as grantee in the patent. That his statement of the fact in the deed is no proof tending to establish that fact.  The Court instructed the jury that they must be satisfied from the evidence given to them, to wit, by the deed and other documents in evidence, and the circumstances of the case, that the grantor in the deed to Sterling is the same person to whom the patent was issued  and they declared their opinions that such was the fact. The principle is well established, that a Court may give their opinion on the evidence to the jury, being careful to distinguish between matters of law and matters of opinion in regard to the facts. When a matter of law is given by the Court to the jury, it should be considered as conclusive  but a mere matter of opinion as to the facts, will only have such influence on the jury as they, may think it is entitled to. The law knows of but one Christian name, and the omission or insertion of the -middle name, or of the initial letter of that name, is immaterial  and it is competent for the party to show that he is known as well without as with the middle name. 5 Johns. Rep. 84. 12 Peters, 456. We think there was no error in the Circuit Court, either in admitting the deed, or in their instruction to the jury on the point stated. A deed from Sterling to Walter Dunn, the lessor of the plaintiff, for the premises in controversy, was objected to on the ground   that the delivery thereof was not proved nor acknowledged in the acknowledgment and proof thereof thereon endorsed.  This deed is not in the record, and it cannot therefore be inspected   nor can it indeed be considered in reference to th  objection. But the same question is raised, it seems, on this deed as was made on the deed from Buchanan to Sterling, and the remarks of the Court on that exception would be equally applicable to this, if the deed to Dunn were in the record. The evidence of the lessor of the plaintiff being closed, the defendants offered in evidence a certified copy of a paper purporting to be a deed from the auditor of Brown county, to John S. Wills, dated the 22d April, 1824, for two hundred acres of land in the tract claimed by. the. lessor of the plaintiff  which the Court overruled, on the ground that it could riot be received without proof that'the requisites of the law, which subjected the land to taxation and sale, had been complied with,   The defendants then offered the same, deed or copy of a deed, accompanied by a duly certified copy of the record of the proceedings, at and before the sale of said land, for taxes, dated 9th May, 1838, certified by Hezekiah Lindsey, county auditor of said county of Brown, which the Court overruled. The laws of Ohio, imposing a tax on lands, and regulating its collection, like similar laws in, perhaps, almost all the other states, are peculiar in their provisions, having been framed under the influence of a local policy. And this policy has, to some extent, influenced the construction of those law s. There can be no class of laws more strictly local in their character, and which more directly concern real property, than these. They not only constitute a rule of property, but their construction by the. Courts of, the state should be followed by the Courts of the United States, with equal if not greater strictness than the construction of any other class of laws. It will be found from' the Ohio reports, that the Supreme-Court has required a claimant under a tax title to show, before his title c n be available, a substantial compliance with the requisites of the law.. In 2 Ohio Rep. 233, the Court say,   the requisitions of the law are substantial and useful, and cannot be dispensed with. Tax sales are attended with greater sacrifices to the owners of land than any others. Purchasers at those sales seem to have but little conscience. They calculate on obtaining acres for cents, and it stands theiri in h nd to see that the proceedings have been strictly regular.^ ^ In the'case of the Lessee of Holt s Heirs vs. Hemphill s Heirs, 3 Ohio Rep. 232, the Court decided that a deed from a collector of taxes is not available to transfer the title, without proof that the land, was listed, taxed, and advertised,  &c. The act of the 2d February, 1821, provides, that all deeds of land sold for taxes, shall, convey to the purchaser all the right, title, and interest of the former proprietor, in and to the land so soFd  and shall be received in all Courts as good and sufficient evidence of title in such purchaser.  Under this and similar provisions, which are found in the various tax laws up to 1824 , the Courts of Ohio seem  never to.have held, that the deed on a tax sale is admissible as evidence of title, unaccompanied by proof that the substantial requisites of the law, in the previous steps, had been complied, with. The collector, or person making the sale, was considered as acting under a special authority, and that his acts must be strictly conformable to law, to divest the title of real property, without the consent of the owner. And the purchaser at such sales is held bound to see that the requirements of the law, which, subjected the land to sale for taxes, had been strictly observed. These principles have been repeatedly sanctioned by this Court. We will now examine the statutes under which' the sale in question was made, with the view -of ascertaining whether the Circuit Court erred in overruling the record of the auditor, offered in evidence to-suppo.rt the tax deed. The act of the Sth February, 1820, and the act to amend the same, of the 2d February, 1821, are the laws under which the title in question was obtained. The county auditor is required to make out from the  books or lists in his office, every year, a complete duplicate of all the lands listed in his office', subject to taxation, with the t xes charged thereon. In which duplicate he shall state the proprietor s .name, the numb r of entry, for whom originally entered, the quantity of land contained in the original entry, the county, water course, number of acres, whether first, second, or third rate land, and the amount of taxes charged, thereon. These matters of description are required to be entered in' separate columns, opposite the name of the proprietor. And the auditor is required to keep a book  for that purpose, and to record in the form above specified, the lands entered in his county for taxation. If the tax be not paid in the county by the 20th November, or to the state treasurer by the 31st December, in each year, the lands are to remain charged with all arrearages of taxes, and the lawful interest thereon, until the same shall be paid  to which there shall be added a penalty of twenty-five' per- cent, on the amount of tax' charged for each year the- same may have been delinquent. , The auditor of the state is required to compare the list of defalcations transmitted from each county auditor with th  duplicates sent to, .his office from said County, for the same year   and to record in a book kept f r that purpose, the delinquent lands,- and charge the same with penalties- and interest. And the county auditor is required, in making out the duplicate for his county, to .charge each tract, in addition to the tax, for the current year, with the tax, interest, and penaltjfof the preceding year, which shall be entered in.a separate column, to be' designated for that purpose-on said duplicate.   And when lands are returned delinquent for two years, the penalty and interest are to be charged for each year by the state auditor, who .is required to transmit the same to the county auditor  and he is forbidden to enter lands a. second time delinquent on the duplicate for the current year. . On receiving this list of lands, a second time delinquent, the auditor. is required to advertise the same six weeks successively in a newspaper printed in the county, which advertisement shall state the amount of the tax, interest, and penalties due on each'tract, and the time of sale, &c.- All sales' are to be made, by the county auditor  and on such sal  being made, he is required < to mak 'a fair  entry descriptive thereof, in-a book to be provided by him for that purpose,  and shall also'  record in said book all the proceedings relative  to the advertising, selling, and conveying said delinquent lands  which record shall be good evidence in all Courts holden within this state/  The record offered in evidence is -stated to be a   record of the proceedings relative to the advertising, selling, and conveying the lands delinquent for tax, for the years 1821, 1822, and 1823, within the county of Brown, and state of Ohio.    Be it remembered, that the following lands, as herein set forth, advertised for sale, in the names of the person to each tract annexed, were regularly entered on the duplicates for taxation, by the auditor of Brown county, for'the year 1821  the tax whereon not being paid for said year, the collector of said county returned the same as delinquent therefor  whereupon the said county auditor made out and transmitted-to the auditor of state, a list of said lands so returned as delinquent  and afterwards a list of said lands, with the amount of taxes, penalty, and interest charged thereon, was transmitted by the auditor- of state to the county auditor of said county  whereupon a copy thereof was published three weeks in succession in a newspaper printed at Georgetown, Brown county, Ohio, in general circulation in said county  and afterwards the county auditor, in making out the duplicate for said county the succeeding year, to wit, for the year 1822, charged each tract in addition to the tax for said year 1822, with the tax, interest, and penalty of the preceding, and sent the same out a second time for collection  the tax on said land not being paid for the year 1S22, they were a second time returned delinquent for the non-payment of the tax, penalty, and interest charged thereon  a list of which was again transmitted to the auditor of the state  that afterwards the said auditor of the state did transmit,  &c. This, together with the advertisement published six months before the sale of the land, is the-record and only evidence offered to show that the legal requisites of the law had been complied with, previous to the sale of the land. The first objection which arises to this paper is, that it is a mere historical-statement of the facts as they occurred, and not a copy from the record. The first important step is to show that the land was listed for taxation.' On this depends the validity of the subsequent proceedings. And bow is this shown by this record? It states that  the land was regularly entered on the duplicates for taxation, and sent out for collection for the year 1821,  &c. Now this is a mere statement of the fact, and not an exemplification of the record. The record of the auditor shows in what manner the land was listed for taxation, the amount of tax charged, the description of the land required by the law, and the rate at which it was entered. But tire auditor in the record before us has stated that the entry or list was regularly made, without copying the same from his records, which copy would enable the Court to determine whether the entry for taxation had been made legally. Now this is- the foundation of the whole proceeding  and unless the Court will substitute the judgment of the auditor for their own, it is impossible for them, to say the land was entered for taxation according to law. Suppose the auditor had, instead of copying the advertisement on which the land was sold, merely stated that the land had been Regularly advertised  could such a statement have been held sufficient ? Perhaps no one acquainted with the legal requisites on this point, could hesitate in deciding that such a statement would be radically defective. That the advertisment constituted an essential part of the .record, as the Court could only judge of its sufficiency by inspecting it. It would not do therefore for the auditor to withhold from his record and the Court, the advertisement, and merely say that it was regular. Clear as this point is, it is not less so than the objection above stated. The listing of the land in conformity to law, is as essential as advertising it. for sale. But in this record we have no evidence that the land was entered according to law, except the mere statement of the fact by the auditor, that it was so entered. Is this statement evidence ? The law makes the record evidence  but this statement is evidently made out, not by copying from the record, but by looking at the record, and giving in a short statement what the auditor supposed to be the f ct. Suppose it should be important in' any other case to show that this land had been regularly entered for. taxation in' the year 1821. Would the certificate of the auditor, in general terms, that the land was regularly entered that year, be evidence ? Must not the record itself be produced, or an exemplification of it  which, would show how it had been entered'  and enable the Court to judge of the regularity of the entry ? That this would be required, seems too clear, for argument  and yet in no possible case could this evidence be so important, as in the case under consideration. - If the Court are to receive the mere statement of the auditor, that the -land was regularly entered, which is the first step in the proceeding, and  as important as any other  to be consistent, they must receive his mere statement,, as proof that the subsequent steps were taken as to the charge of penalties, and interests, and delinquencies, and that it was advertised regularly and sold. This would be a short .mode of arriving at. the result, and might add somewhat to the validity of the titles, in disregard, however, to the rights of the nonresident land holder. The law requires the auditor, on receiving the list of delinquent lands from the state auditor, to give public notice by advertisement, for three weeks in succession, in some newspaper in general circulation in his county, of the amount of taxes charged, &c. Now, if-this advertisement be not published, the land cannot be returned by the auditor a second, time as delinquent  and if not regularly returned as delinquent twice, it is not liable to be sold. And what evidence is there in the record that this notice was given. There is none,'but the mere statement of the fact that such notice was given three weeks in succession, in a hewspaper printed in Georgetown. Now, if the statement of the. auditor be sufficent as. to this notice, it must be held equally good as to the notice of the sale. This land was transmitted from the auditor of the state twice, charged with penalties, to the county auditor, who, by the thirty-sixth section of the act of 1820, was required to publish the same, when received, three weeks  but it seems from his record that this notice has been but once given. And, again, there.is no evidence that the penalties were charged, and the interest added, but the mere statement of the auditor. What amount was charged as penalty, and the amount of interest added, nowhere appears. In the list published in the notice of sale, if does not appear at what rate the land was entered for taxation  and the gross sum of fifty dollars is charged, without showing of what items it was composed. In the case of Lafferty s Lessee vs. Byers, 5 Ham. 458, the plaiutiff offered in evidence an exemplified copy of the books of the county auditor, showing the listing for taxation, and the advertisement of the sale. Upon the whole, we think that the Court did hot err,- in rejecting the paper certified by the auditor as a record. We think that this record contained no evidence that the land was regularly listed for taxation  and that it was defective.in not showing that other important requisites of the law had been complied with. That it is a mere historical account of the facts as they transpired, and not the record evidence of those facts, as they appear or should appear on the.record.' Under the law of 1824, which makes, the tax deed prima facie evidence, the Ohio Courts have not required proof to the same extent in support of the deed, as before such law. But the present case does not com  under.this law.  and it is unnecessary to go into its construction by the Ohio Courts. 5 Ohio Rep. 370. The defendants gave in evidence a duly authorized transcript of the'record, proceedings, and .decree, of the Supreme Cour$ of the state of Ohio, of a certain case, wherein White s heirs and J. S. Wills  heirs, and H. Brush, were complainants, and David Buchanan, deceased, in his lifetime, defendant  and his unknown heirs. defendants after his death, by bill of revivor  wherein the title to the premises in question, and other lands, were decreed to complainants. And here the defendants rested their case. The Court were asked to instruct the jury, by the defendant, that it was necessary for the plaintiff to prove the calls of his patent for the ground, by establishing the different corners, &c. But the Court refused to give the instruction as requested, and informed the jury, that, by a rule of Court, the defendants having entered-into the consent rule, were bound to admit, at the trial, that they are in possession of the premises claimed by the lessor of the .plaintiff. And there can be no doubt that, under the rule, this decision of the Court was correct! This was not a dispute about boundaries, but of title  and in such a case, the rule referred to is salutary, and supersedes th  necessity of proving the possession of the defendant. Without this rule, it would have been incumbent on the plaintiff to. prove the possession  but this could have been done by any one who had a general knowledge 'of the land in controversy, and who could state that the defendant was in possession. And the Court instructed the jury, that the pendency of the suit against Buchanan and his heirs, could in no sense be held constructive notice to Sterling, in receiving the deed from Buchanan, after the commencement of the suit, unless the process had been served, or publication made, before such deed was executed. There can be no doubt that this instruction was proper  and, upon the whole, we affirm the judgment of the Circuit Court. This cause came on to be heard on the transcript of the record from the Circuit Court of the United.States for the District of Ohio, and was argued by counsel. On consideration whereof, it is ordered and adjudged by this Court, that the judgment of the said Circuit Court in this cause be, and the same is hereby, affirmed, with costs. attorneys:  The case was argued by Mr. Mason, for the plaintiffs   in error  and by Mr. Corwin, with whom Was Mr.' Bond, for the defendant.    Mr. Corwin, for the defendants, corrections:  head_matter: John F. Games and Nathan Gilbert, Plaintiffs in error, vs. John Stiles, ex dem. of Walter Dunn, deceased, Defendant in error. A deed was executed in Glasgow, Scotland, by which land in Ohio, which had bqen patented tp David Buchanan by. the United States, was conveyed to Walter Sterling. The deed recited that it was made in pursuance of a decree of tlie Circuit Court of the United States, for the District of Virginia. No exemplification of the decree was offered in evidence in support of the deed. The Court held, that as Buchanan was the patentee of the land, although he made the deed in pursuance of the decree of the Circuit Court of Virginia, the decree fcould add nothing to the validity of the conveyance  and therefore it was wholly unnecessary to prove the decree. The deed was good without the decree. The possession of a deed, regularly executed, is prima facie evidence of its delivery.   Under, ordinary circumstances, no other evidence of the delivery of a deed than the possession of it, by the person claiming under it, is required. The grantor in the deed was David Carrick Buchanan  and he declares in it that he is the same person who was formerly David Buchanan. The Circuit Court were required to charge the jury that it was necessary to convince the jury, by proofs in Court, that David Carrick Buchanan is the same person as the grantor named in the patent, David Buchanan  and that the statement by the grantor was no proof to establish the fact. The Circuit Court instructed the jury that they-must be satisfied from the deed and other documents, and the circumstances of the case, that the grantor in the deed is the same person to whom the patent was issued  and they declared their opinion that such was the fact. By the-Court: The principle is well established, that a Court may give their opinion on the evidence to the jury, being careful to distinguish between matters of law and matters' of opinion, in regard to the .fact. When a matter of law is given by the Court to the jury, it should be considered by the Court as conclusive  but a mere matter of opinion as to the facts, will ohly have such influence on the jury as they may think it entitled to. The. law knows of but one Christian name,' and the omission or insertion of the middle .name, or of the initial letter of that name, is immaterial  and it is competent for the party to show that he is known as well without as with the middle name. A deed of lands sold for taxes cannot be read in evidence,, without proof that the requisites of the law which subjected the land to taxes had been complied, with. There can be no class of laws more strictly local in their character, and which more directly concern real property, than laws imposing taxes on lands, and. subjecting the lands to sale for unpaid taxes. They not only constitute a rule of property, but their construction -by the Courts of the state should be followed by the Courts of the United States, with equal if not with greater strictness than any other class of laws. The Supreme Court of Ohio has required a claimant under a tax title to show, before his title can be available, a substantial compliance with the requisites of the'law. In an action of ejectment, the defendants having entered into the consent rule, the plaintiff in Ohio is not to be called upon to prove the calls of the patent under which he claims, on the ground of establishing the different corners. The defendants are bound to admit, after they have entered into the consent rule, that they are in possession of the premises claimed by the lessor of the plaintiff. IN. error to the Circuit Court of the United States for the District of Ohio. In 1836, the lessee of the defendants in error instituted an action of ejectment against the plaintiffs in error, in the Circuit Court of the United States for the District of Ohio, for a tract of land lying between the Little Miami and Sciota rivers, in that part of the state of Ohio known as the Virginia Military District, being on a survey under a part of a military land, warrant for one thousand acres. The cause was tried at July term, 1838, and a verdict and judgment were, entered for the plaintiffs in the action, the defendant in error. On the trial of the cause, the defendant tendered a bill of excep-> tion?. The bill of exceptions states, that the plaintiff offered in evi-' dence in support of his action: First, A certified copy of a deed from David Carrick Buchanan to Walter Sterling, dated June 27th, 1825. The patent from the United States, dated 22d May, 18.02, ft>r the land in controversy, was granted to David Buchanan by the President of the United States, and the deed .was executed by David Carrick Buchanan, stating that he had formerly been David Buchanan. The defendants asked the Court to instruct the jury, that the statement in the deed by the grantor, that he had formerly been David'Buchanan, is.no proof that he was David Carrick Buchanan. This instruction the Court refused. -The deed from David. Carrick Buchanan recited that'the deed was executed in conformity with a decree of the Circuit Court of the United States for the Fifth' Circuit, in the Virginia District, to convey the .land described in it to Walter Sterling, in fee simple. The defendants excepted further to the introduction of the deed in evidence, because the proceedings of the Circuit Court of the United States in Virginia, recited in-the deed, were not produced with it. But the Court overruled the objection. Second, The defendants in their defence offered in evidence a certified copy of a paper, purporting to be a deed from William Middleton, auditor'bf Brown county, to John S. Wills, bearing^ date April 2 2d, 1824,for two hundred acres of land  and insisted it was duly acknowledged as such deed, and such copy was duly certified by the recorder of Brown co nty. The deed from William Middleton, the' auditor of Brown county, re'cited that a sale had been made bf two hundred acres of land, by William Middleton, county auditor, to John S. Wills, on -the 29th December, 1823, for arrearages of taxes due to the state of Ohio, for 1821, 1822, 1823, for the lands conveyed ' the land being part of the land patented to Buchanan. The deed particularly described, by metes and bounds, the tract conveyed, and granted the. same, to John S. Wills, in fee simple. It was duly acknowledged according to the laws of Ohio, and recorded, in the proper office. The plaintiff objected to this deed as not competent to go to the jury without evidence bf the proceedings and acts of the public officers, prior, and at the sale of said land for the tax  and insisted it ought to be- admitted: and the Court sustained the objection, and overruled the .evidence, and declared their.opinion that the same evidence should not be admitted, and the same was rejected accordingly. The defendants then offered the same deed or copy of deed, accompanied by a duly certified copy of the record of the proceedings,  t and before the sale of said land for taxes, bearing date 9th May, 1838, certified by Hezekiah Lindsey, county auditor of said county of Brown  which copies or papers, and certificates thereon, are referred to . as a part of the bill of ^ exceptions  whereupon, .the plaintiffs, by counsel, objected to the admission of the same on the ground that the sam  did not contain all tlie legal requisites to justify and authorize said sale and conveyance of said land for taxes  and of this opinion was the Court, and declared their opinion tobe that the same ought not tobe admitted in evidence in,this case, and the same were rejected accordingly. .   The defendants below, gave in evidence a transcript of the record of the proceedings and decree of the Supreme Court of the state of Ohio, in a case-wherein White s-heirs and J. S. Wilis  heirs, and JH. Brush were complainants, and David Buchanan, in his lifetime, was defendant  find his unknown heirs, after his decease, were, by bill of revivor, made defendants . wherein the title to the premises in question w s decreed to the complainants' in-tljat suit. The defendants asked-the Court to- instruct the jury, that, the' record ^of the proceedings and decree given in evidence- by defend-. ants, m y be considered by the jury as conveying the title to the land in controversy in that suit, to the complainants therein, and will, and ought to affect parties and privies, who had knowledge of the same, to prevent their taking title from the defendant therein from-the time-such knowledge existed. In place of this instruction, the Court instructed the jury, that to prevent Buchanan from making a good deed to those lands', it was. necessary, he should have notice, actual or constructive, prior to the.'making such,deed  and of the  commencement of the suit  the service of the process or the order- of publication, giving such notice to appear and answer  and such'publication m d , to be proved: if th  jury should find the. deed from Buchanan to Sterling, was dated June 27th, 1825,' and was-at that time delivered,.and. the order of -the Court' for the publication not made until August .following, as appears-in the recor.d aforesaid, -it was competent for Buchanan to make such deed to Sterling  and the Court declared their opinions accordingly. The defendant prosecuted this writ of error. The case was argued by Mr. Mason, for the plaintiffs   in error  and by Mr. Corwin, with whom Was Mr.' Bond, for the defendant. The counsel for the plaintiffs in error, Mr. Mason, assigned the following reasons for, the reversal Of the judgment of the Circuit Court: First, That on the trial of the cause, the Court- admitted as evidence in th  cause, a paper purporting to be a deed from, or signed by David Carrick Buchanan to Walter Sterling, as appears by bill of exceptions  which, for the reasons stated in the bill of exceptions should not have been admitted in evidence. Second, There is also error in this, that the Court, oh the trial aforesaid, admitted in evidence to the jury a copy of another .paper, purporting to be a deed from Walter Sterling to Walter Dunn  which, for the reasons. stated in the bill of exceptions, ought not to have been admitted in evidence. Third, There is also error in this, that the Court refused to admit a certified copy of a deed from William Middleton, auditor of Brown county, to John S. Wills, for two hundred acres of land, for the reasons stated in said bill of exceptions  whereas the same evidence ought to have been admitted. Fourth, There is also error in this, that said Court refused to admit the same deed or copy accompanied by a duly, certified copy of the record of the proceedings, at and before the sale of said lands for taxes, for the reasons stated in the bill of exceptions   whereas, said evidence ought to have been admitted. Mr. Corwin, for the defendants, contended, that the proceedings of the Court in Virginia were not necessary to the validity of the deed  that a good consideration is stated in the deed, independently of that decree  that the title being in Buchanan, he had a right to convey with or without the authority of the decree. 2. That it was not necessary, that the acknowledgment should aver or recite the delivery of the deed   that possession of the deed was evidence to go to the jury of its delivery  that the recital of delivery in the deed, is evidence of that fact. 3. That the recital in the deed, showing that the grantor, David Carrick Buchanan, Esq.,'was the same person formerly called David Buchanan, Esq., was evidence to go to the jury of the identity of the person named in the deed and patent. The counsel for the defendant also insisted, that it was incumbent on the party offering evidence of title growing out of a sale for nonpayment of taxes, to show that the law was in all material respects complied with under which the auditor acted  that neither the deed nor the record of the auditor shows such compliance. See 18 Ohio Laws, 70. 4. That the defendants below claiming title under Brooke, through whom the lessor of plaintiff also claimed, it was not competent for them to dispute the-validity of their common title. 5. That the identity of the land in question with that described in the title papers, is shown by the descriptive calls recited in the declaration, and those in the title papers of the plaintiff below, and is admitted by the consent rule. The defendant below asked the Court to charge the jury, that the statement in the deed from Buchanan to Sterling, reciting that David Carrick Buchanan, Esq., was formerly called David Buchanan, Esq., was no evidence that it was the same person who received the patent, and conveyed to Sterling. The Court refused so to charge, and instructed the jury that they must be satisfied from the deed, other documents, and the circumstances of the case, that David Carrick Buchanan, and David Buchanan, Were the same person  and declared their opinion, that such was the case  to which opinions the defendants excepted. 1. The defendant in error insisted, that this exception only questions the propriety of the opinion given to the jury as to the fact of identity, as arising out of the proof before them. 2. That it was proper for the Co rt-to. give such opinion, leaving the jury to decide on it for themselves. 1 Peters, 182. 190. 10 Peters, 80. 3. That the recital in the deed is evidencfe to be considered by the jury, with other proofs in the cause, to show the identity of the grantee of the United States with the grantor to Sterling.\n",

      "judges:   parties:  John Knox, James Boggs, and James A. Knox, trading under the firm of Knox, Boggs, & Co., Appellants, v. Peyton Smith and others, Defendants. opinions:  Mr. Justice McLEAN delivered the opinion of the court. This is an appeal from the decree of the Circuit Court for the. District of West Tennessee. In their bill the complainants state that they recovered a judgment in the Circuit Court against Thomas Eckford and.Probert P. Collier, for the sum of three thousand four hundred and sixty-two dollars and twenty cents, &c.   and that execution was issued the 24th of April, 1840, which, about the 18th of July ensuing, was levied on sev nteen negroes and four mules  and that the rr .rsha . took a delivery bond and security, under the statute of T nnessee. That one Peyton Smith, a citizen of the State of T ennessee, pretending to claim said property levied upon by virtue of some fraudulent, .deed of trust executed by Probert P.w Collier to him, filed   bill,'which/prayed for an injunction, in the Circuit Court, and which was refused. That the delivery bond being forfeited, an execution was issued on it, against the principals and sureties, which was levied upon the same negroes and mules   upon which execution the marshal returned that u the property levied on had .been taken from him by the sheriff of Tipton county, under the order of the Chancery Court, at Brownsville, 5th December, 1840.  The bill alleges that the negroes and mules belonged to Collier, and it prays that they may be sold in satisfaction of the judgment. There is no allegation in this bill which authorizes a court of equity to take jurisdiction of the case. Fraud is not charged, nor is any thing stated going to show that the remedy at law is not complete. It is stated that Peyton Smith, pretending to claim the property, after the first levy, by. virtue of some fraudulent deed of trust executed to him by Collier, applied to the Circuit Court, by bill, for an injunction, which was refused. The present bill was not filed by the complainants until after execution was issued on the delivery bond and levied, and the property was taken, as returned by the marshal, under State process. Now, if the object had been to set aside the deed of trust, as fraudulent, the fraud, with the facte connected with it, should have been alleged in the bill. Or if the negroes and mules were about to be taken out of the State, and beyond the jurisdiction of the court, unless restrained by an' injunction, such fact should have been stated. But the principal allegation in the bill is, that under the State authority the sheriff had no right to take the negroes, &c. If this be admitted, it does not follow that the remedy of the complainants is in a court of equity. On the contrary, from the showing in the bill, there is a plain remedy at law. The marshal might have brought trespass against the sheriff, or applied to the Circuit Court for an attachment. Out of the answer which sets up the deed of trust, the complainants insist they are entitled to relief. Now no relief can be given by a court of equity, except a proper case be made in the bill. The inquiry is not only whether the defendant, from his own showing or by proof, has acted unjustly and inequitably, but also, whether the complainants, by their allegations and proof, have shown that they are entitled to relief. The decree of the Circuit Court is affirmed, with costs. attorneys:  The case .was argued by Mr-. Brinley, for' the appellants, and Mr. Milton Brown, for the appellees.    Mr. Brinley, for the appellants.    Mr. Milton Brown, for the appellees.    Mr. Brinley, in reply. corrections:  head_matter: John Knox, James Boggs, and James A. Knox, trading under the firm of Knox, Boggs, & Co., Appellants, v. Peyton Smith and others, Defendants. A bill in chancery which recites, that the complainants had recovered a judgment at law in a court of the United States, upon which an execution had issued and been levied upon certain property by the marshal  that another person, claiming to hold the property levied upon by virtue of some fraudulent deed of trust, had obtained a process from a State court, by which the sheriff had taken the property out of the hands of the marshal  and praying that the property might be sold, cannot be sustained. 1 If the object had been to set aside the deed of trust, as fraudulent, the fraud, with the facts connected with it, should have been alleged in the bill. There exists a plain remedy at law. The marshal might have brought trespass against the sheriff, or applied to the court of the United States for an attachment. No relief can be given by a court of equity, unless the coinplainant, by his allegations and prooij has shown that he-is entitled to relief. This was an appeal from the Circuit Court of the United States for the District of West Tennessee, sitting as a court of equity. The appellants had filed a bill against the defendants, which bill was-dismissed by the Circuit Court. The facts in the case were these. On the 23d of March, 1839, Probert P. Collier, of the county of Tipton and State of Tennessee, executed to Peyton Smith, of the same State, a deed of trust, reciting the indebtedness of Collier to sundry persons, and proceeding as follows :      Now, the above-named creditors, to wit, Robert B. Clarkson, Jordan Brown, Isaac Killough, Stephen Smith, James D. Holmes, Samuel A. Holmes, Joseph T. Collier, and Forsythe, Goodwin, & Co., merchants of New Orleans, being willing to wait and give the further indulgence of  eighteen months longer from the date of this indenture with the said Probert P. Collier, upon having their debts and the interest accruing thereon   and the said Probert P. Collier being willing to give them a certain assurance that their money shall be paid at the expiration of eighteen months from this date   and the said Probert P. Collier being extremely desirous to save harmless and secure from all liabilities his indorsers as above described on the several notes already specified in this indenture as such indorsers. .    Now, therefore, this indenture witnesseth, that the said Probert P. Collier, as well, in consideration of securing the said Robert B. Clarkson,' Jordan Brown, Isaac Killough, Stephen Smith, James D. Holmes, Samuel A. Holmes, Joseph T. Collier, and Forsythe, Goodwin, & Co.,-merchants of New Orleans, in the faithful payment of their debts and interest as aforesaid, and securing, and saving harmless his indorsers as aforesaid, .as also the sum of one dollar to him the said Probert P. Collier in hand paid by the said  Peyton Smith, the receipt whereof is hereby acknowledged, hath this day granted, bargained, sold, transferred, assigned, and set over, and by these presents doth grant, bargain, sell, transfer, assign, and set- over unto the said Peyton Smith the following real estate and personal property, to wit, as hereafter described, to wit:   ' (The deed then enumerated several tracts of land, some slaves, horses, mules, and furniture, and proceeded as follows.)'    And each and every of them to. the said Peyton Smith, his heirs and assigns, to the proper use and behoof of the said Peyton Smith, his heirs and assigns, for ever.    In trust, however, and to the intent ar.1 nurpose, that if the said three notes, payable to the said Robert B.

In witness whereof, the said Probert P. Collier hereunto sets his hand andseal, this the 23d of March, 1839. PROBERT P. COLLIER, [seal.] PAYTON SMITH. [seal.] c< Witnessed by J. P. Farrington, F  M. Green.  On the 4th .of December, 1839,- Knox, Boggs, & Co,, citizens of Pennsylvania, brought a suit in the District Court of the United States, possessing Circuit Court jurisdiction, and sitting for the District of West Tennessee, against Thomas Eckford and Probert P. Collier, as indorsers of sundry promissory notes held by Knox, Boggs, & Co. On the 8th of April, 1840, a judgment was rendered against these defendants in the above court, for the sum of $ 3,56^*20. On the 24 th of April, 1840, a writ of fieri facias, founded on the foregoing judgment, was issued, and the execution levied on seventeen negroes and four mules, as the property of P. P. Collier, being a part of the property included within the deed to Peyton Smith. A forthcoming bond was.taken, with the following condition : -    Now, if the said P. P. Collier shall deliver the property at Covington,, on the 21st day of September, 1840, then and there to be sola to satisfy said judgment and cost, then this obligation to be void   else, to remain in full force.

SMITH, [seal.]  About this time, although the record does not say precisely when, Smith, the trustee, applied to the judge , of the District Court for an injunction to. restrain the sale, upon the ground that the property belonged to him and not to Collier, but the judge declined to gran, it. He then applied to the Chancery Court at Brownsville (a State court of Tennessee), and, upon filing his bill for relief, obtained ah injunction.  On the 21st of September, 1840, when the property was to be delivered under the forthb ming bond, the marshal made the following return..   Bond forfeited, and sale of the negroes and mules levied pn enjoined by order of the Chancery Court at Brownsville, 21st Sept., 1840. ROB T J. CHESTER, Mar. West T nn.  On the 27th of October, 1840, an alias fieri facias was issued Upon the judgment in the District Court,'- and placed in the hands of the marshal, who levied-it, on the 6th of November, upon the same negroes and mules which were the subjects of the former execution. Another forthcoming bond was given for the delivery of the property on the 5th of December, 1840. On the 20th of N.oveniber, 1840, .the Chancery Court at Brownsville issued the following order.   State of Tennessee : To the Sheriff of Tipton County, greeting : . {  Whereas, it hath been represented unto the chancellor, in our  Chancery Court af Brownsville, in the western division of the State of Tennessee aforesaid, on the part of Peyton Smith, trustee, &c., complainant,' that he has lately exhibited his amended bill of complaint in our said Chancery Court,   against Knox, Boggs, & Co., P. P. Collier, and Robert J. Chester, defendants, to b  relieved touching the matters therein complained of  in which said bill it is, among other matters, set forth, that the said defendants are combining and confederating to injure the complainant touching the matters set forth in said bill, and that their actings and doings in that behalf are contrary to equity and good conscience.   We, therefore, in consideration of tire premises, do strictly command you, the said'sheriff of Tipton county, Tennessee, that you do absolutely seize and take into your possession, immediately and forthwith, at all hazards, the following negro slaves, to wit: Jack, Jim, Jane, Marcella, Zilpha, Washington, Margaret, Doll,-Bryant, Toney, Catharine, Cully, - Cynthia, Sam, John, Clara, and  Lucinda, heretofore levied on by the marshal of West Tennessee, as the property of said Collier, to satisfy a judgment in favor of' said Knox, Boggs, & Co.   and do you safely and s'ecurely keep said slaves, so that you have them forthcoming to abide the' further order of our said Chancery Court   and this- you shall in no wise omit, under the penalty prescribed by law.   11 Witness, Sheppard M.

ASHE, Clerk and Master On the 5th of December, 1840, when the second forthcoming bond was due, the sheriff, acting under the order of the Chancery Court of the State, and the marshal, acting under the execution issued by the District Court of the United States, both made returns. The sheriff s return was as follows :   u Levied this attachment on all the within-named negroes, except Jim, who was not found, nor was he levied on by the marshal of Tennessee. J.

The marshal s return was as follows.:    c The property executed, delivered according to bond  and then arrested from me by the sheriff of Tipton, under an order of the Chancery Court at Brownsville   bill filed   see inclosed. R0B  J  CHESTER, Mar-   5th Dec., 1840. On the 8th of April, 1841,' Knox, Boggs, & Co. filed a bill in the District Court of the United States (the same pourt in which they had obtained their judgment), reciting all the circumstances of the. case, stating that Smith claimed under a fraudulent deed of trust, and alleging that a State court had no right, power, or jurisdiction to enjoin the process issued fromth  District Court  , that Collier and the securities upon the delivery bond combined and confederated with Peyton Smith to prevent the sale of the property levied upon, and so defeat the execution of the complainants, who had now no adequate and complete remedy at law. The bill prayed that. Collier and Smith and all the securities, might be made defendants to answer, and that the property might be sold to pay the judgment obtained by the complainants. Some of the defendants demurred to the bill, but the demurrers were overruled, and they were ordered to answer. On the 10th of November, 1841, the Chancery Court at Brownsville passed., the following decree in the case of the bill which had been filed by Peyton Smith, and in which he had obtained an injunction, as before stated.   Be it remembered, that this cause came on to be heard on this, the tenth day of November, eighteen hundred and forty-one, before the Hon. A. McCampbell, chancellor, upon the orders pro confesso against said defendants. And it appearing to the satisfaction of the court, that in March, eighteen hundred and thirty-nine, defendant Collier made a deed conveying to complainant, amongst other things, the following negro slaves, to-wit :  Jack, Jim, Washington, Margaret, Doll, Marcella, Zilpha, Bryan,   Toney, Catharine, Cully, Ghloe, Phillis, Sam, John, Lucinda, and Cynthia   which said deed was executed by said Collier to complainant in trust to secure the payment of certain debts in the same specified   and by the terms of said deed said Collier' was to remain in possession of the property conveyed in the same for the space of eighteen months from and after the execution of said deed   and in the event that the debts specified in said deed were not paid on or before the expiration of the eighteen months from the time of the execution of said deed, the property specified in the same was to be sold by complainant, and. the proceeds arising from said sale to be applied by him to the liquidation and settlement of the debts set forth in said deed.   And it further appearing, that said deed was duly proven and registered, and that the debts specified in said deed are bona fide, and due and owing, with the exception of about five hundred-dollars, which has been paid by said Collier since the execution of said deed   and that said deed was executed in good faith, and there is nb fraud in the same.   And.it further appearing to the satisfaction of the court, that  fter   the execution, probate, and registration of said deed, defendants Knox, Boggs, & Co. recovered a judgment' in the District Court of the United States, in the eighth circuit, for the State of Tennessee, at Jackson, for about the sum of three thousand four hundred and sixty-two dollars and twenty cents  upon which said judgment a writ of fieri facias issued to defendant Chester   who, by virtue of said writ of-fieri facias, seized and took into his possession said negro slaves, Jack, Jim, Washington, Doll, Marcella, Zilpha, Bryant, Toney, Catharine, Cully, Chloe, Phillis, Cynthia, Sam, John, and Lucinda, and that defendant Chester was about to sell and dispose of said negroes slaves.   And it further appearing to the satisfaction of the court, that defendants acquired no lien on any of said several negroes slaves by virtue of their said judgment and execution  and that said slaves ought not to be appropriated .in satisfaction of the same.   It is therefore ordered, adjudged, and decreed by the court', that the injunction heretofore awarded in this cause be made perpetual  and that said defendants Knox, Boggs, & Co., and said Robert J. Chester, be, arid are hereby, restrained perpetually from selling or otherwise controlling either of said slaves under and by virtue of said judgment and execution.   It is further ordered, that the sheriff of Tipton county deliver said negroes over to complainant  that complainant pay all costs herein expended, for which execution may issue. And that complainant recover of defendants Knox, Boggs, & Co., and Robert J. Chester, the costs of- suit herein expended  and that defendant Collier recover of complainant the cost by him about this suit expended   for which executions may issue.  In April, 1842, the respondents answered the bill filed by Knox, Boggs, & Co. in the District Court. It will .only be necessary to refer to the answers of Smith and Collier.   Smith denied that the deed of trust made to him was fraudulent as against creditors, but averred that the same was made in good faith   that he was governed by no other feeling or desire than a wish to discharge his duty as trustee   that the cestui que trust looked to him to protect the property   denied all combination and confederation with any person, &c., &c. Collier admitted the truth of the facts as they are set forth in the preceding part of this statement, denied that the deed to Smith was fraudulent, but averred that it was made in good faith, &c., &c. In May, 1842, a general replication was filed by the complainants. On the 5 th of August, 1842,' interrogatories were filed on the part of the complainants, and the depositions of four person, taken. Chester, the marshal, was asked to state the value of the property conveyed by the deed of trust, to which he answered' as' follows. Answer.    I believe, from the ages, &o , of the negroes mentioned in the deed of trust, and what I saw of them when delivered to me, that they were worth, at the date of conveyance, seven to eight thousand dollars I do not know what the. mules and horses are worth, nor am I acquainted with the Value, of the land or the town lots.  . Harris and Smith answered as follows. Answer.  I, J. W. Harris, have examined the deed referred to in said interrogatory, and suppose the negroes, judging from their age and size, as stated in said deed of trust, to have been worth, at the date o*f said deed, seven thousand six hundred and fifty dollars   not being personally acquainted with but few of them, can only state their value from what appears to be their ages in the deed. Horses and mules supposed to .be worth four hundred dollars   household and kitchen furniture supposed to be worth four hundred and eleven dollars, including spinning-machine, barouche, blacksmith s tools, and loom. As to the land, I have no idea what it was worth, never having been upon it that I know of, and not being acquainted with the value of land.      I, A. W. Smith, answer and say, that I am acquainted with the property conveyed in the deed mentioned in the above interrogatory, and believe it to have been worth, at the date of the said deed, ten thousand thre  hundred and sixty-six dollars.  Clarkson was interrogated as to the amount which Collier owed to him, to which he responded, that it was a balance of eleven or twelve hundred dollars. On the 16th of October, .'  43, the cause came on to be heard on bill, answers, replication, and proof, when the bill was dismissed, with costs. From which decree an appeal brought the case up to this court. The case .was argued by Mr-. Brinley, for' the appellants, and Mr. Milton Brown, for the appellees. Mr. Brinley, for the appellants.  It may -be proper to make two statements, preliminary to arguing the points which are most material. The one is, that the original action was instituted in the District Court of the United States for West Tennessee. That was a correct proceeding, because that court had Circuit Court jurisdiction imposed upon it by the act of January 18th, 1839. 5 Lit. & Brown s ed. 313. The other remark is, that the delivery bonds adverted to were taken in conformity to the laws of Tennessee. They provide, that when any execution may be levied on real or personal property, if the debtor shall give sufficient security to the officer to have the goods and chattels forthcoming at the day and place of sale, it shall be the duty of the officer to take a bond payable to the creditor for double the amount of execution, reciting the service of the execution, and the amount of the money due thereon, conditioned for the true performance of the same. Laws of Tennessee, 1801, ch, 13 (Caruthers & Nicholson s Compilation, 129). The act of Tenness e of 1831, ch. 25, provides, in the first section, that the- securities in such a bond, if forfeited, shall not be responsible for more than the value of the property. The second section provides, that if an execution be, levied upon personal property, and bond and security shall be given for the delivery of the property upon the, day of sale, and the bond shall be forfeited, in whole or in part, then the officer shall proceed to levy upon so much of the defendant s property as maybe found, as shall be  sufficient to satisfy the. execution   if he finds no property of the defendant, then he shall levy upon property of the security or securities in said forfeited delivery bond. Laws of Tennessee (Caruthers & Nicholson s Compilation), 129. Let us now pass to the consideration of the points arising out of an examination of the deed of trust. It is dated March 14th, 1839   and by it Collier conveys to Smith six parcels of real estate, negroes, horses, mules, furniture, and other property, in trust, to pay certain notes with, interest, provided they are not paid by said Collier, or some other person for him, before the   expiration of eighteen months from the date of. the deed   if not paid by that time, Smith is to sell the property at auction for ready money. By the deed, Collier is to keep and retain the land and personal property in his own possession until the expiration of said eighteen months. The deed is made to secure the paymert of twelve notes, amounting to a trifle over $ 6,000. The value of the property conveyed, according to the testimony of Smith, is $ 10,366. Such an amount of property conveyed to secure, not all, but a portion, of'Collier s creditors, without any.stipulations for a release, indicates fraud in regard to other creditors   .more especially as there is no proof of the validity of the debts. By the laws of Tennessee, every gift, &c., made with the intent, to delay or defraud creditors of their just and lawful actions, suits, debts, &c., are wholly and utterly void, except as against the person making the same. Act of 1801, ch. 25,   2. Again  the deed of trust had matured before the second levy, of the plaintiff s execution, and the property remained in the hands of the debtor   that is, the trustee had not taken possession of it at the time limited for the payment of the money. There was no proof that the trust was bona fide. The legal presumption upon this state of facts is, that the trust i  fraudulent and void as to creditors, and the onus lies on the trustee to prove the contrary, and to prove the validity of the debts. Possession remaining with the vendor, after an absolute sal , or with the grantor or mortgagor in deeds of trust and mortgage, after the time when the debt secured by the latter should be paid, is prima facie evidence of fraud   but the presumption of fraud may be repelled by proof of fairness in the transaction, and that the instruments were executed for an adequate consideration. Maney v. Killough, 7 Yerger, 440. The marshal, therefore, had a right to levy on the slaves as the property of the debtor. The property had been levied on by the marshal, on the first execution, and a bond taken before the  trust matured, and the bond was forfeited. But that did not prevent the trustee from taking possession of the negroes after the bond was forfeited   because a forfeiture of 'the bond released the property from all lien or liability on account of the levy, and it again became a part of the debtor s general property, and might have deen taken by the trustee, without legal hindrance, so far as the first levy was concerned. Where an execution is levied, and bond taken for the delivery of the property on the day of sale, the lien of the execution continues until the bond is forfeited. It is then discharged, and the property is subject to the claims of other creditors. Malone . Abbott, 3 Humphrey, 532. The levy of the marshal was therefore valid as against the trust, which, for want of proof to the contrary, was fraudulent. This levy vested the title in the marshal for the benefit of the plaintiffs, to pay their debt by execution   it was a lien , created by law, which could not be enforced at law, because the marshal was forcibly prevented by the interference of the State tribunals, called into existence by the defendants. Their only remedy was in equity to enforce their lien, to prevent multiplicity of suits, conflicts of jurisdiction, an^to inquire into the fraudulent conveyance by the deed pf trust. A judgment creditor, haying a lien on personal property, has a right to come into chancery to remove obstacles thrown in the way of the due execution of his process by a levy and. seizure, of the property by a junior judgment creditor. Parrish  . Saunders et al., 3 Humphrey, 431. This is an analogous case. The courts of Tennessee have decided, that a suit in equity can be brought for slaves, from the peculiar nature of the property. Loftin v. Espy, 4 Yerger, 84. A fortiori, to enforce a lien upon them. Lastly   the State court had no authority to enjoin an execution issuing from a court of the United States. McKim v. Voorhies, 7 Cranch, 279   3 Story on the Constitution, 625,    1751, 1752   United States v. Wilson, 8 Wheat. 253   1 Kent s Comm. 409. It is true that the .national courts have no authority (in-cases not within the appellate jurisdiction of the United States) to issue injunctions to judgments in the State courts   or in any other manner to interfere with their jurisdiction or proceedings. 3 Story on the Constitution, 626,   1753   Diggs et al. v. Wolcott, 4 Cranch, 179. But the federal court had complete jurisdiction in this case, by injunction, to prevent the sale of tHe property levied upon by execution from its court. Parker t>. The Judges of the Circuit Court of Maryland, 12 Wheat. 561. And as the State and federal courts had concurrent jurisdiction (Act of September 24th, 1789,  11  1 Lit, & Brown s ed. 78) of the action brought at law, and the .suit in equity which arose out of it, the federal court having first acquired jurisdiction, the same cannot afterwards be taken from it by the State courts. Under such circumstances, the aid of the United .States court is not an irregular interference with the proceedings of the State tribunal. If the State courts have jurisdiction to enjoin the-marshal from selling specific property in possession of the defendant, they may enjoin for all his property, or for any number of adverse claimants   and thus, in effect, entirely defeat the plaintiff s execution. . At. the same .time, an injurious conflict of jurisdiction would be produced, inconsistent with the harmony which ought to exist between the State and federal jurisdictions.  Where the-jurisdiction of the federal courts has once attached, no subsequent change in the relation or condition of the parties will oust' the jurisdiction.' The strongest considerations of utility and convenience  require that, the jurisdiction being once vested, the action of the court shall not be limited, but that it should proceed to make a final disposition of the-subject.  United States v. Myers, et al., 2 Brockenbrough s Rep. 516. Mr. Milton Brown, for the appellees. The principal and leading question in this case arises on the demurrer to the bill  for if this be adjudged for the appellees, there is an end of the case. The bill, if its allegations be true, states a case.of clear and unembarrassed remedy at law. When analyzed, it amounts to this:  That complainants had recovered a'judgment at law, on which execution issued, and had been levied by the marshal of West Tennessee, on seventeen negroes and four mules, the property of Collier, one of the debtors in the execution, for the forthcoming of which, on the day of sale, a delivery bond had been taken, with sureties.^ -That onC Peyton Smith had applied to the Circuit Court of the United States, from which the execution had issued, for an injunction to restrain the sale of said negroes   which application, however, was refused by the coyrt. That afterwards, the property not having been delivered on the day of sale, the bond was forfeited   and on this judgment of forfeiture another execution issued against die defendants .in the original judgment, and. also the sureties in the forfeited delivery bend   on which last execution another levy was made, and another del very bond, with new surety, taken. Tlie bill then adds :     Upon this last execution the marshal made the following return : The property executed, delivered according to bolid, and then arrested from me by the sheriff of Tip-ton, under order of the Chancery Court at Brownsville, 5tb December, 1840.  The next two paragraphs then disclose the points on which the supposed equity of the bill is made to rest. They ara as follows-.   And your orators further show, that the said Peyton Smith, although your honor refused to grant an injunction restraining the sale of said negroes levied upon, has, by some means or other, procured from the State courts of the State of Tennessee a process of injunction  or some other process, enjoining the sale of said negroes and property levied upon by virtue of the executions issuing from your honorable court, and has procured one Josiah Horne, the sheriff of Tipton county, a citizen of the State of Tennessee, to arrest and take possession of said negroes from the custody of the marshal of this court  and the said Josiah Horne has still possession of said property so levied upon as aforesaid, and refuses to deliver the same to the marshal, of the Western District, to be sold according to law.  Your orators further show, that said negroes and mules were the property of said Probert P. Collier, and liable to be sold for the debt due to your orators, and that the State courts had no right, power, or jurisdiction to enjoin the process issued, from this honorable court  and your orators believe, and so charge, that the said Collier and the securities upon said delivery bond combined and confederated with said Peyton Smith to prevent the sale of the property levied upon, and so defeat the execution of your orators   and your orators have now no adequate and complete remedy at law.  On tnese vague  uncertainties and allegations, meaning nothing and amounting to nothing, the debtors in the original judgment, the sureties to both the delivery bonds, and Peyton Smith and the sheriff of Tipton, are all made defendants. And it is only remarkable, that in this wholesale business, the chancellor of West Tennessee was not included. The prayer of the hill for specific relief is,   1. That the negroes   be sold to pay the judgment d e to your orators.  2.   That said defendants be jointly and severally bound personally to pay said judgment and interest to your orators.  And lastly,     That said negroes be forthcoming, to abide the decree of this honorable court.  An injunction was.prayed for, but not granted. To this bill the defendants severally demurred. The demurrers were overruled by the court below, and the defendants required to answer. And now comes up the question, whether there is suffix cient equity in the bill, and stated with sufficient legal certainty, to authorize a decree to be made on it. And first, as to the defendant Peyton Smith, against whom there is equity, if against any one. The point is, the improper suing out of process and arresting the property from the possession or the marshal. If it be the design of the bill to invoke the chancery powers of the court, to control or decide any real or supposed conflict between the federal and State judiciaries, the exercise of such a power would be alike unwarranted and dangerous. But this is probably not the object of the bill. It proceeds on the ground that the process was wholly and absolutely void. What the process was, whether an injunction or a final process of execution, either in law or chancery, is not stated. The vague and unmeaning allegation is, that it was   a process of injunction, or some other process.  Nor is it stated on what this very uncertain process was sued out, or on what it was founded  whether on a final decree in . chancery, on a final judgment at law, or on an  pplication for an injunction, does not appear with any degree of legal certainty. The allegations are, that said Peyton Smith,   by some means or other,   procured from the State courts of the State of Tennessee a. process of injunction, or some other process,  by which the sale of the slaves by the marshal had been prevented  and that the State courts   had no' right, power, or jurisdiction   to issue this process. Nqw, if these allegations be true, the process, whatever it might be, was absolutely void, and all acting under it trespassers. The marshal should have paid no attention to it  and if the property was taken without his consent, an action of trespass or trover, in his name, by virtue of his levy, was the plain remedy 1 If the process in the hands of the marshal was, as is here alleg d, wrongfully and unlawfully obstructed or interfered with, it certainly furnishes no ground on which to invoke the chancery powers of the court. The case would be much nearer the province of a grand jury than the conscience of a chancellor. In this it is not designed to intimate, that, in point of fact, there was any unlawful or improper interference with the rights of the marshal or the complainants. Nor is it designed to intimate that there was any conflict of jurisdiction between the federal and State courts. It is believed there was no such interference, and no such conflict. But for the purposes of the argument on the deniurr r, the facts are taken as stated in the bill. The attempt in the appellant s brief to sustain the bill, on the ground of its being filed to set aside a fraudulent deed of trust, finds no support in the allegations or frame of the bill itself. The case made in the bill is the alleged improper issuance of thh process from the State courts, and the seizure of the property. On what this process issued, as already clearly shown, is not stated. There is nothing on the face of the bill to show, with sufficient legal certainty, .that the existence of a deed of trust is the subject of complaint. .   Every material fact to which the plaintiff means to offer evidence ought to be distinctly stated in the premises.  Story s Eq. PI.  28. If fraud is charged, it must be distinctly'and clearly set out.

The only reference in the bill to a deed of trust is a mere, historical reference in the statement that Peyton Smith had applied to the Circuit Court of the United States for an injunction, which was refused. It is not charged that any other or further use was ever made or intended to be made of it. Before the issuance of the   process   from the State courts, of which complaint is made, there had, as appears on the face of the bill, been an entire change in the nature of the question. The delivery bond had been forfeited, a new statutory judgment bad attached, a new execution had issued, embracing not merely the former defendants, but the sureties in the delivery bond also, a new levy under this execution had been made, &c., &c. This   process,  therefore, which is spoken of in the bill in such remarkably indefinite terms, might h ve been founded on an intervening judgment or decree in chancery, taking priority of lien, p's happened in the case of Brown v. Clarke, decided at die present term of this court. In that, case it was decided that, on the forfeiture of a delivery bond, the first lien was extinguished and a new lien attached, and that intervening liens might take precedence. May this not have been the case in this very instance,, so far as any thing appears on the face of the bill ? In fact, the language of the bill favors this conclusion. It says that,   by some means or other,  process. was sued out. Does this not leave it wholly uncertain whether this process was obtained by  means  of a deed-of trust, or by that   other   means referred to ? But again   the bill says there was sued out   a process of injunction, or some other process,  thus leaving it entirely uncertain what that   other process  was. Might not that   other process   here referred to have been founded on an intervening judgment or decree, creating a prior lien, and entitled to prior satisfaction ? These considerations are deemed sufficient to show that the reference to the deed of trust in the bill is too indefinite and uncertain to require an answer, or form an issue, and can furnish no possible ground for equitable interference. A statement of facts, to form the,basis of relief, must not be vague and uncertain. And if, as in this case, they are stated in the alternative, or are otherwise left doubtful, it is such uncertainty as will be bad on general demurrer. Story s.Eq. PI.    243-249 and 450. Upon what ground the sureties in the delivery bonds have, been made parties it is hard to perceive. Complainants alreadv If^d judgments and executions against them on the forfeiture  what more did they want ? There is nothing in the bill against them, except a general charge of combination and confederacy, which cannot be a sufficient ground of jurisdiction   and, if charged, need not be answered. Story s Eq. Pi.    29 and 856. If the demurrers are sustained by the court, there is, of course, an end of the case   should they be overruled, another question presents itself. Can the reference to a deed of trust, in the answer, put that in issue which was not substantially relied on in the bill ? That it cannot is clear. Gresley on Ev. 22   Story s Eq. Pl.   36, in note  Boone v. Chiles, 10 Peters, 209   Harrison and others v. Nixon, 9 Peters, 503   Jackson v. Ashton, 11 Peters, 249. In this last case the court say,     It may be proper to observe, that no admissions in an answer  an, under any circumstances, lay the foundation for relief under any specific head of equity, unless it be substantially set forth in the biU.  But there is another reason why the statement in the answers, in the present condition of the' case, cannot be regarded. The real persons interested in the deed of trust are not made parties   and this may also be regarded as another proof that the bill is framed with a view to no such end. Peyton Smith is a mere trustee, without interest  his answer cannot prejudice the rights of the cestuis que trust  and, though a party of record, is a competent witness. Gresiey on Ev. 242, 258. The true rule seems to be, that the cestuis que trust should be made'parties in all cases where the  existence or enjoyment of the property is affected by the prayer of the suit.  Calvert on Parties, 212. To make,' therefore, the admissions or statements in the answers of those having no interest in the trust work an injury'to those who hold the real interest, would be to violate not merely the established'rules of pleading and evidence, but the most obvious rules of substantial justice. While it is believed that this is the law of the case, and that no decree, on several grounds, can be made touching the rights of the cestuis que trust, it is, with equal confidence, believed that there is not the slightest ground to infer fraud in the execution of the trust. It was designed to give a preference to Collier s own creditors over debts for which he was a mere security. This, he had a lawful right to do. The debts designed to be preferred amounted to over seven thousand dollars, besides interest. The highest estimate placed on all the property is $ 10,366. But this is palpably an overestimate, as is proved by the fact that one witness says the seventeen negroes were worth   7,650     while another witness thinks they were worth seven or eight thousand, dollars. And yet the face of the bill shows, that the same negroes were valued on each levy by the marshal when inserted in the delivery bonds   the first time valued at $ 4,100,  nd the last time at $ 4,250. This proves that the estimate attempted to be placed on the' property, for the purposes of this cause, is entirely too high. It is believed that at, no time would it have sold under the hammer for enough tb meet the debts named in the deed of trust. One other suggestion will close this brief. The' question of the validity t>f this d ed has been before the Chancery Court of the 'State, where the parties in interest have been properly represented, and the result has been a decision in favor of the rights of the eestuis que trust  and it is' fair to suppose that the trust, under the direction of the court, has, before now, been wound up, and justice done. Mr. Brinley, in reply. 1. It is insisted by the counsel for the appellees, that there, was. a remedy at law  that if the property was taken from' the marshal without his consent, he had a remedy by action of trespass or trover. This objection is anticipated and met in the opening argument for the appellants. 2. It is contended that there were too many persons made defendants by the bill. Who are they ? Peyton Smith, the person claiming the, property under an alleged fraudulent deed of trust  Collier, the assignor in said deed. The former should be included beyond a doubt  so, too, the latter. Where the assignment is not absolute and unconditional, or there are remaining rights or liabilities of the assignor, which may be affected by the decree, there the assignor is not only a proper, but a necessary, party. Story on Eq. PI.   153. Eckford, being one of the judgment debtors, was of course a party. Bryan, Feezer, and Smith were securities on the delivery bond given on the levy of the first execution  they, together with Boon, were securities on the delivery bond given on the levy of the second execution.. They were all made parties to the bill, on the principle that those in interest must be brought into court. . By the statutes of Tennessee, as sureties to a forfeited delivery bond, their property might be levied o , and they had a direct interest in the subject. Besides, they were distinctly charged in the bill as confederating with Collier and Smith to prevent the sale of the property levied on. Horne was the sheriff who arrested the property from the marshal, and he was therefore made a party.' This   wholesale business  was but a compliance with the rules of equity applicable to the circumstances. . 3. It is then contended that there are not parties enough  that the cestuis que trust are not included. It may be true, as a general rule, that all persons interested in the subject of a suit should be made parties as plaintiffs or defendants, in order that a complete decree may be made  but there are exceptions. Thus, residuary legatees are interested in the object of a suit by a creditor against the executor, to establish his debt or claim against the estate  for the establishment of such debt or claim goes pro tanto in direct diminution of their interest in the residue. Yet they are never required to be parties. Calvert on Parties, ch. 1, p. 5. So trustees for the payment of debts and legacies may sustain a suit either* as plaintiffs or defendants, touching the trust estate, without bringing the creditors or legatees before the court as parties. Fenn v. Craig, 3 Younge and Collier, 2161 In case of assignment for benefit of creditors, the assignees may file a bill relative to the trust estate, without making t&e creditors parties   for the assignees are the proper representatives of all of them. In a suit to set aside an assignment as fraudulent, it is sufficient to make, the fraudulent assignors and assignees parties. Wakeman t . Grover, 4 Paige, 23. In the present case, Smith, the trustee,- must be considered as the representative of the interest of all parties. It was not necessary to make the cestuis que trust parties   the complainants knew not who they were. Memo tenetur divinare. 4. The bill is said to be vague and unmeaning, because it states that   a process of injunction, or some other process,  enjoining the sale, proceeded from the State court. The bill states, in the words of the return on the fi. fa., that the property was arrested from the marshal   under order of the Chancery Court at Brownsville.  It then states, in the next paragraph, in reference to this order and arrest, that it was by  an injunction or some othfer process.  If the language of the return had been used in that paragraph, it would'have been sufficiently certain.  the alternative phrase employed is not less so. The sections in Story on Eq. PI.-, referred to by the counsel for the appellees, are to the point, that when the allegations in a bill are extremely vague, loose, and uncertain, or where the title of a plaintiff is stated in the alternative, so that the respondent does not know what he is to answer, they are not sufficient. A general charge or statement of the matters of fact is sufficient, and it is not necessary to charge minutely all the circumstances which may conduce to a general charge  Story on Eq. PI.  28,, Here the general charge is, that the sale.on the execution was enjoined by process from the State court, and the property arrested from the marshal. That is minute enough, particularly as the precise character and appellation of the process were known to Smith, who obtained it. Moreover, a charge in general terms, where it is the point on which the merits of the cause turn, and does not come in' collaterally and incidentally, will warrant the production of evidence to particular facts. 2 Atk. 333, 337. A plaintiff is not bound to set forth all die minute facts which go to constitute a charge   and where the title to relief will be precisely the same in each case, the plaintiff may aver facts of a different nature, which wijl equally support his application. Story on Eq. PI.    252, 254. The cases cited by the counsel for the appellees, from the reports of this court, are to die undisputed point, that a party is not allowed to state one case in a bill or answer, and make out a different one by proof. No such attempt is made in this case the allegation in substance is,-that an injunction, or a process of like nature issued   that is put in issue. The proof, as obtained from the admissions in the answers of Smith, Collier, Feezer, Bryan, Horne, and Booner is within the allegation, that an injunction issued. In the case of Jackson v. Ashton, 11 Peters, 249, the court said,     The answer of the defendant is broader than the allegations in the bill  and, although such parts of the answer as are not responsive to the bill are not evidence for the defendant, yet the counsel on both sides have considered the facts disclosed as. belonging to the case  and if the facts in the answer,-not responsive to the bill, are relied on by the complainants  counsel as admissions by the defendant, he is entitled, thus far, to their full benefit.  So here the counsel, throughout the progress of the cause, have considered the fact that an injunction issued as belonging to the case. It was disclosed (admit it for the argument) in the answer of Smith, though not substantially set forth in the bill  -yet the complainants shall have the full benefit of the admission. The words,   or other process,  may be considered surplusage. 5. It is sajd there is nothing on the face of the bill to show that the deed, of trust was the subject of complaint. The bill expressly states, that Smith claimed the property under a fraudulent deed of trust, and that he pursued that claim by the intervention of the State court. An illegal proceeding, based on a fraudulent conveyance, is the charge. The reference to the deed of trust is said to be in the statement. There it ought to be   for the. statement constitutes the real substance of a bill. Story on Eq. PI.   27. 6. The   process   from the State court, it is argued, may have been founded on an intervening judgment, creating a prior lien, &c. Such a supposition is wholly at war with the true state of the case, as disclosed by the allegations in the bill, and the admissions in the answers. 7. The counsel for the appellees states, that u the highest estimate placed on all the property is $ 10.366     and therefore there is no reason for inferring fraud. Fraud may not be conclusively established from that circumstance only   but it is one of a number of circumstances which unitedly afford strong presumption of fraud in regard to creditors. 8. The closing remark of the counsel for die appellees, that the validity of the deed of trust has been established by the court of chancery of the State, is, as it purports to be, a   suggestion,  and which cannot affect the decision of this court.\n",

      "judges:  Before TANEX, Circuit Justice, and HEATH, District Judge. parties:  THOMAS v. WATSON. opinions:  TANEX, Circuit Justice. The court has taken time to examine this case with care, because the points raised in it are important, and some of them do not appear to have been fully settled by -judicial decisions. The case, as it comes before the court, is this: James Murray Lloyd, named in the proceedings, gave two promissory notes to Watson, the defendant, upon which a suit was afterwards instituted in this court, and judgment confessed by Lloyd, on the 18th of April, 1844, with an agreement entered on the record that no execution should issue on the judgment, provided the amount was paid by tbe defendant in four equal annual instal-ments, counting from tbe day of entering tbe judgment, and in case of default in any in-stalment, execution to go for tbe whole sum then due. On tbe 15tb of August 1S4 , Lloyd petitioned for tbe benefit of tbe insolvent laws of Maryland, and tbe complainant in this case was duly appointed bis permanent trustee for tbe benefit of bis creditors. .Default having been made by Lloyd in tbe payment of tbe instalments hereinbefore mentioned, Watson issued an execution for tbe amount due on tbe judgment, which was levied upon lands held by Lloyd at the date of tbe said judgment  and thereupon, on tbe 18th of December ISIS, tbe complainant, as trustee, filed this bill, and obtained from tbe district judge tbe injunction now in question. Since tbe injunction issued, tbe answer of defendant has come in, and upon tbe facts stated in tbe answer, it is unnecessary to examine any of tbe allegations in tbe bill, upon which the injunction was granted, except those wbicn relate to the consideration of tbe two notes given by Lloyd to Watson, and upon which tbe judgment in question was confessed. The bill charges that one of the notes was given upon an usurious, and tbe other upon a gambling, consideration  offers to pay tbe amount actually loaned by tbe defendant to Lloyd, with legal interest thereon  prays to be relieved from the residue of tbe judgment  and calls on tbe respondent to state what was tbe consideration for which tbe said notes were given. To this interrogatory tbe defendant has demurred, setting forth as bis cause of demurrer, that tbe consideration of tbe .said notes was triable and determinable in tbe suit at law, and ought not, therefore, to be inquired into by this court, sitting as a court of chancery. Tbe complainant excepts to this answer as insufficient, insisting that tbe defendant is bound to answer tbe interrogatory above mentioned  and the case now com- e on, upon tne bearing of tbe exceptions, and upon tbe motion to continue tbe injunction. Several points have been raised in the argument, which will be noticed hereafter, but tbe main question in tbe case is. upon tbe effect of tbe judgment confessed in tbe action at law. Tbe complainant, as trustee under tbe insolvent law, stands in tbe place of Lloyd  and undoubtedly tbe latter might, in the suit against him, have availed himself of tbe defences stated in tbe bill, and might have barred tbe action of Watson by pleading tbe matters now insisted on. As be failed to do so, be would not. in ordinary cases, be permitted to ins st - n them in a court of equity, aftei having neglected to rely on them in tbe suit at law. But it does not follow that the same rule is to be applied where contracts are made, or securities taken. in violation of law. or contrary to declared and established policy  and of this description are all securities, by note or otherwise, intended to secure usurious interest, or for money won at play. in such eases *he court are called upon to consider, not only tbe laches of tbe party who may have been grossly negligent in asserting bis rights, but must look also to tbe conduct of tbe adverse party, and determine whether it is consistent with sound principles of jurisprudence, to protect him in tbe enjoyment of profits derived from securities taken in violation of tbe express provisions of a statute, and which tbe law declares shall be void. Undoubtedly, it is within the legitimate province of courts of justice, and it is their duty in tbe exercise of tbe powers confided to them, to carry into full effect the policy of tbe law, when that policy is sufficiently and clearly manifested. Nor can they suffer it to be defeated or embarrassed, by the application of rules which do not belong to cases of that description, but are appropriate to another class of cases, and which have been adopted in them, for tbe purpose of preventing unnecessary litigation, where nothing more is concerned in tbe issue than tbe individual rights of the contending parties. Tbe distinction between these two classes of cases, and tbe different rules which govern them, have been frequently recognised, where a party, by bis voluntary act, has put it out of bis power to use a legal defence which would have protected him from tbe payment of tbe claim. Thus, in ordinary cases of contract, if a party pays money with a full knowledge of the facts, but under the mistaken belief that he is bound by law to pay it, and afterwards discovers bis error, be cannot recover it back again by any proceeding at law or in equity. iTet, in a case of usury or gaming, although be pays it not only with a knowledge ot the facts, but with a knowledge of tbe law also. equity will relieve him and compel tbe adverse party to refund tbe money. As respects usurious interest paid to the lender, the amount paid over and above tbe legal interest may be recovered back again either by a suit at law or a bill in equity. 1 Fonbl. Eq. bk. 1, c. 4,   7, note k As regards a security for money lost by gaming, it was, indeed, said by Lord Talbot, that it could not be recovered, both parties being equally in fault  but that point did not arise in tbe ease before him  it was an obiter dictum, when deciding upon a question of usury  and the point was decided otherwise in tbe case of Uawden v. Shad-well. Amb. 2(ii). In tbe last-mentioned case, a bond had been given for money lost at play, and part  of the money paid upon tbe bond  yet tne court, upon a bill filed for that purpose, decreed that tbe bond should be delivered up to be canceled, and tbe money repaid. Indeed, there can be no sound reason for distinguishing securities for money won at play from securities founded in usury, so as to give any advantages to tbe former over tbe latter  for they are both prohibited by law, both contrary to  its settled policy  and while the laws against usury are intended to protect the necessitous against the oppression of the money-lender, .and against hard and ruinous contracts forced upon them by their wants, the laws against gaming are founded upon a policy equally sound and clear, and are intended to discountenance and discourage a vice injurious to society, and often most ruinous to the individual. If, therefore, the money had been paid by Lloyd upon these two notes, it is evident, that the complainant might, upon a bill filed, have recovered it back. And if a court of chancery would have interfered, after the money had been actually paid, is there any principle of equity which will prevent it from interposing, where the party has omitted to defend himself at law, and confessed a judgment? There is nothing, certainly, in the technical character of a judgment that will prevent the interposition of a court of equity, for it is one of its ordinary functions to relieve against judgments at law, where a proper case is made out in equity. And if it will lend its aid to the party, after he has acknowledged the justice of the debt by the payment of the money, there can be no sufficient reason for refusing to interpose where the party has omitted to make the defence in an action at law, and acknowledged the debt by confessing the judgment. In either case, the court acts to prevent the party from retaining an advantage which he has obtained, under a contract forbidden by law, and to uphold an established public policy, intended, in the one case, to guard against oppression, and in the other, to suppress a vice injurious to society. If the mere confession of a judgment at law would secure a party in his ill-gotten gains, the statutes passed upon these subjects would be nugatory, since they could be constantly and easily evaded by substituting a confession of judgment in the place of a note or bond, or other security. When the public policy established by the legislature is so obvious, and is so clearly founded in the principles of justice, and required by the interests of society, it would ill become a court of equity, by narrow and technical constructions, to deprive itself of the power of enforcing it. These principles are supported by high judicial authority. So far as the question of usury is concerned, the precise point before us appears to have been decided in the court of appeals of Maryland, upon full argument, in the case of West v. Beanes, 3 Har. & J. 568, and also in Fanning v. Dunham, 5 Johns. Ch. 142. It is true that, in the last-mentioned case, a warrant of attorney to confess the judgment was executed at the same time with the bond, and might perhaps be regarded as-one of the securities taken by the lender  but the case evidently was not decided merely on that ground, but was likened by the court to   the case of a borrower who had voluntarily paid the money, and thereby put it out of his power to resist, as defendant, the claim of the creditor. As regards the money won at play, it is truly said, in 1 Story, Eq. Jur.    303, 304, that there is no difference, in principle, between usurious and gaming contracts, in this respect, as the securities in both cases are void at law, and the contiacts in each case against its policy. We concur in these doctrines, and think the omission of Lloyd to defend himself in the action at law is no bar to the relief asked for by the complainant. If the question of usury or not, or of gaming or not, had been made in the suit at law, and decided against Lloyd, undoubtedly, the complainant could not be permitted to try the same questions over again in equity, and consequently, would not be entitled to the discovery he asks for  but these questions were not raised in that suit, and have not yet been decided in any court. The question before us is, whether it is too late now to raise them, and whether the judgment confessed shuts the door against further inquiry into the consideration of the notes upon which it is admitted to have been entered. We think it does not  and that the principle upon which the court grants relief after the voluntary payment of the money, must also entitle the party to relief after a voluntary confession of judgment. In each case, the party, by his voluntary act. has deprived himself of the opportunity of defending himself in a court of law. The act of the general assembly of Maryland, passed at December session 1S4 , after these contracts were made, and indeed, after the bill in this case was filed, cannot, of course, have any influence on this decision. And if it could, it would not materially.affect the principles hereinbefore stated  for although this law abrogates' the penalties inflicted by the act of 1704, in cases of usury, and permits the party to recover the sum actually loaned, with legal interest thereon, yet the contract, so far as the usurious interest is concerned, is still made void, and the policy of the former law upon the subject, in that respect, remains unaltered. * It has, moreover, been insisted, in the argument for the defendant, that the complainant is not entitled to the discovery, because the answer may subject the defendant to a penalty or forfeiture. Upon this point it is sufficient to say, that the defendant has not objected to answering on this ground, and does not aver, in his answer, that the discovery sought, would bring him into any such danger  it cannot, therefore, we think, be relied on in the argument. But if this defence had been made in the answer, it could hardly have been sustained: for. as relates to the usury, it is admitted by the bill, that no money was received by the defendant  and the mere making of an usurious agreement, or taking a bond or other obligation to secure it', does not subject the lender to a penalty or forfeiture. Nor do we perceive how he will be brought into any such danger, by answering that part of the interrogatory which concerns the note alleged to have been given for a gaming debt. If he admits that the note was given for money won at play, it is difficult to imagine how that fact could be used to prove that he kept a faro-bank, or prac-tised any other of those devices upon which the law inflicts a punishment  nor can we imagine how this fact could become a material link in any chain of evidence in a prosecution against him. He is not asked to state the circumstances under which the money was won  he is required simply to say whether the consideration was a gaming debt or not  and there are a multitude of ways in which he may have won the money without subjecting himself to a penalty. In a defence of this kind, the bare statement of the defendant wo'uld hardly be sufficient, even if made in his answer  the court must be satisfied that he has some reasonable and probable grounds to apprehend danger from his answer, in case a prosecution should afterwards be instituted against him. The right to a discovery, so far as it can be maintained on principles of equity, would seem to be peculiarly necessary and appropriate in cases of this kind, where the winner most commonly takes the security in private  where no witnesses are present who know anything of the transaction  and does this, in order to deprive the loser of proof, if he should afterwards endeavor to resist the payment. No doubt an affirmative answer in this ease will prevent the party from recovering the money  but that is not a penalty or forfeiture within the meaning of the law. The object of every bill of discovery is to obtain from the defendant the admission of some fact, which the complainant supposes will enable him to prevent the recovery of some claim which the defendant has made against him, or enable him to enforce a claim against the defendant, which he has not otherwise sufficient testimony to establish. It has been further argued that, as Lloyd himself has not made this defence, nor united in this proceeding, his trustee under the insolvent law has no right to bring these claims into question. But we regard it as settled law, that the permanent trustee, appointed upon the release of the insolvent, becomes immediately vested with all the rights, at law or in equity, which the latter then possessed, and may enforce any right, or make any de-fence, which the insolvent could have maintained or enforced at the time of his insolvency. These rights are transferred to the trustee, and the complainant may now make the same defences, at law or in equity, against these claims and against the judgment upon them, which Lloyd could have made if he had never become insolvent. The first and second exceptions filed by the complainant must therefore be allowed, and the answer of the defendant in those respects adjudged insufficient  and the injunction heretofore granted be continued until the further order of this court. The third exception of the complainant is overruled. attorneys:  John Nelson and J. M. Buchanan, for complainant.    Reverdy Johnson, for defendant. corrections:  head_matter: Case No. 13,913. THOMAS v. WATSON. [Taney, 297.] Circuit Court, D. Maryland. Aug. 27, 1846. Gaming   Usury Penalties Pleading in Equity   Answer Res Jddioata   Insolvency  Suit by Trustee. 1. L. confessed judgment on two promissory notes, one of which was given upon a usurious and the other upon a gambling consideration, and afterwards became insolvent, and a trustee of his estate was appointed under the insolvent laws of Maryland. The trustee-filed a bill for relief from an execution issued upon the judgment, and called on the judgment-creditor to state the true consideration of said notes. 2. On demurrer to the prayer for such discovery, held, that as the defendant had not objected to answering, on the ground that his answer might subject him to a penalty or forfeiture, and had not averred in his answer that -the discovery sought for would bring him into any such danger, he could not avail himself of this defence on the argument. 3. Even if this defence had been made in the answer, it could not be sustained: (1) Because, as to the usury, the mere making of a usurious agreement, or taking a bond or other obligation to secure it. do.-s not subject the lender to a penalty or forfeiture  (2) because, as to the gaming. he was not asked to state the circumstances under which toe monu.v was won  he was required simply to state whether the consideration was a gaming debt or not, and there are many ways in which he might have won the money without subjecting himself to a penalty. 4. Although an affirmative answer would undoubtedly prevent the party from recovering the money, yet that is not a penalty or forfeiture, within the meaning of the law. to excuse him from answering. If the money had been paid by L. upon these two notes, the complainant might, upon a bill filed, have recovered it back. 5. The principle upon which the court grants relief after a voluntary payment of money, must also entitle the party to relief after a voluntary confession of judgment. 6. The omission of L. to defend himself in the action at law, is no bar to the relief asked for  by the complainant ' these questions not having been raised in that suit, nor yet been decided in any court. 7. The rights and defences possessed by L. at the time of his release, are transferred to his trustee  and the complainant may now make the same defences, at law or in equity, against these claims, and against the judgment upon them, which L. could have made, if he had never become insolvent. 8. Although the Maryland act of 1845 (chapter 352) ^abrogates the penalties inflicted by the act of 1704 (chapter 69), in cases of usury, and permits the party to recover the sum actually loaned, with legal interest thereon, yet the contract. so far as the usurious interest is concerned, is still made void, and the policy of the former law upon the subject, in that respect, remains unaltered. The bill in this case was filed on the 18th day of December, 1845, by [Philip F. Thomas] the permanent trustee of J. M. Lloyd. Its object was to obtain relief, by injunction, against a judgment for $6,571.95, recovered in this court on the 18th day of April, 1844, against the said Lloyd, by Henry H. Watson, a resident of the city of New York. It stated that at the time of the confession of said judgment, Watson held two promissory notes of Lloyd, one of which amounted, principal and interest, at the date of the judgment, to about $4.328, and was given in consideration of a loan of money usuriously made by said Watson to said Lloyd: and the other of said notes was given for money lost at play, and for no other than a gambling consideration. That on the day of the rendition of the judgment, or immediately before, an agreement was entered into by the said Lloyd, with the counsel of Watson, to confess judgment for the sum of four thousand dollars and costs  that, at the time of the agreement, the promissory notes were not shown to Lloyd, nor was any calculation made of the amount due on them, the said Lloyd s agreement being to confess judgment for $4.000. and no more  and that he left town with the belief that judgment was so confessed, and remained under that impression till recently  that independently of said agreement, an error was made, as the defendant admits, in the rendition of the judgment, which is for $485.59 more than purports to be due on said notes. That said Watson had caused execution to be issued for the whole amount of the judgment. and had levied upon the lands held by said Lloyd at the date of the judgment, and had advertised the same for sale. That although Lloyd himself did not avail himself of the defences which he might have made to the suit on said notes, yet the complainant, as his trustee in insolvency, and in respect of the rights of his creditors, was entitled to be relieved from the effect of said judgment, to the extent of its excess over and above the money actually loaned by said Watson to said Lloyd, and the legal interest thereon, which he, the complainant, was willing and tendered to pay to said Watson. That the complainant claimed the benefit of said defences to said judgment, which he asked to hare reformed and corrected, and further prayed that the defendant in his answer might say   (1) Whether on the 18th of April, 1844, he was not the holder of two promissory notes given to him by James Murray Lloyd, and if he was, what was the amount due thereon, on said day, and that he might produce the same. (2) Whether said notes were ndt then in the possession of his counsel, in the city of Baltimore, and did not constitute the claim upon which the judgment in the circuit court of the United States for the district of Maryland, thereinbefore referred to, was rendered? (3) Whether said judgment was not rendered in pursuance of a supposed agreement with James Murray Lloyd, the defendant therein, and whether the same was not erroneously so rendered? (4) W'hether the agreement in this bill alleged to have been entered into by said Lloyd, was not, in fact, the agreement he did make? (5) What was the consideration for which said notes were given by the said Lloyd to him, the said Watson, and what the consideration of each of them? A short copy of the judgment was exhibited with the bill. The injunction prayed for was granted on the 20th of December, 1845. On the 10th of January, 1846, the defendant, Watson, filed his answer, in which he admitted the application of Lloyd for the benefit of the insolvent laws, the appointment of the complainant as his permanent trustee, the due execution of his bond, and the rendition of the judgment, as stated in the bill  but denied that any mistake was committed in the rendition of said judgment, except the one of 8485.59, mentioned in the bill, which the defendant s counsel agreed to correct, immediately upon its discovery. He stated that, at the time of the confession of said judgment, he did hold two promissory notes of said Lloyd, which were placed in his counsel s hands for collection,, and were deposited in this court at the time of the rendition of the judgment on them  but he denied that any such agreement as was set forth in the bill, in regard to said confession of judgment, was ever entered into, but he was informed by his counsel, and believed, that the only agreement made in reference to said confession of judgment was an agreement to confess judgment for the whole amount of the claim represented by said notes. To the first interrogatory he answered, that he was, at the time therein mentioned, the holder of two promissory notes of the said Lloyd, which were filed as aforesaid, and the amount due thereon was the sum stated in the judgment, less the amount aforesaid erroneously calculated as interest. To the second interrogatory he answered, that said notes did constitute the claim upon which said judgment was rendered. To the third interrogatory he answered, that said judgment was rendered upon the agreement stated in his answer, and upon no other agreement, and that there was no error in the rendition thereof, except the one stated in his answer. To the fourth interrogatory he answered, that there never was any such agreement as stated in this interrogatory. And the defendant, by protestation, not confessing or acknowledging all or any of the matters and things in the said bill contained, touching the consideration of the said notes, as being tainted either with usury or gaming, demurred thereto, for the following cause, to wit, that the said matters were triable and determinable, and available to the said Lloyd, at law, and ought not to be inquired of by this court. Wherefore, and for divers other errors and imperfections, the defendant prayed the judgment of this court, whether he should be compelled to make any further or other answer to said bill, or any of the matters and things therein contained. To this answer the complainant excepted, the grounds assigned being   (1) That said defendant, in his answer, did not admit or deny the allegation, in the bill of the complaint contained, -that the consideration of the note first therein mentioned, being the promissory note of the said James Murray Lloyd, for $4,000, was founded on an usurious consideration, but on the contrary thereof, had wholly omitted to answer the same. (2) That said defendant, in his said answer, did not admit or deny that the other promissory note referred to in the complainant s bill, being the promissory note of the said James Murray Lloyd, for $2,500, was founded on a gambling consideration, but on the contrary thereof, had wholly omitted to answer the same. (3) That the demurrer in said answer contained was insufficient, because   First. It contained no certificate of counsel that, in his opinion, it was well founded in point of law. Second. It was not supported by the affidavit of the defendant that it was not Interposed for delay. Third. The same was unfounded in law. The defendant afterwards supplied the affidavit to the demurrer.

      "judges:   parties:  Love, Plaintiff in Error, v. Simms s lessee, Defendant in Error. opinions:  Mr. Justice Johnson delivered the opinion of the Court. This, cause comes up from the Circuit Court for the district of West Tennessee. The judgment in that Court.is in favour of the plaintiff in ejectment, and error is brought to reverse that judgment, on the ground that the Court below instructed the jury that the plaintiff there had the better title, and ought to recover. The facts of the cause are exhibited in a bill of exceptions, and, so far as are necessary to illustrate this opinion,, may be stated thus: One Stockly Donaldson obtained a grant of lands of the State of North Carolina, in that region of territory which. lies west  f the Cumberland mountain, and now composes a part of West Tennesse. This grant issued upon an entry made in the office of John Armstrong. After obtaining the patent, Donaldson executed a power of attorney to one Grant, to sell, this land, and Grant accordingly sold it to one Allison, and executed a conveyance to him in due form. This deed bears date'in 1795. But it appears, that two years previous to this sa!e   Donaldson himself had executed a title for the same land to one Adair. And the plaintiff in ejectment noiv makes title through Allison, while the defendant protects himself under the conveyance to Adair, but without connecting himself with it. If the case rested here, there would be no difficulty in it  but, by the laws of North Carolina, no deed passes an estate, unless it be recorded in the county in which the land lies, and that within twelve month? of its date. In this instance, the subsequent deed claims precedence, on the ground of prior registration,, after the twelve months prescribed to the prior deed, and, of consequence, at a time when the prior deed was,supposed to be altogether void, for want of registration. On the point of registration the facts are these. The act of 1.715, which is the registering act alluded to, has been suspended, as to the limitation of time, almost ever since its enactment. A similar provision in the land laws of that State, on the subject of registering grants, has also been the subject of a similar suspension. But as there was no County Court embracing within its jurisdiction that region of country in which this land lay, a new provision is introduced into the suspending act of 1788, by which it is enacted, that persons owning lands of this description, shall register them in. the counties in which they reside  and a proviso, as to non-residents, is inserted, in these words:   Provided always, that persons owning such lands in this State, west of the Cumberland mountain, and not residing therein, shall register their grants for such lands in Hawkins county.  The holder of the junior conveyance from Donaldson, availed himself of this proviso, or (more properly speaking) en cting clause, and recorded it, with all his muniments of title, in Hawkins county. This took place in the year 1797, but the defendant below, the holder of the senior title from Donaldson, did not record his title until the year 1806, when, the State of Tennessee having created a county embracing this land, he committed his deed to registration in the county where the land lay  which was also done by the plaintiff below, four years afterwards. If, then, the registration in Hawkins county was a valid registration, and the effect of it was to vest the estate, to the prejudice of the prior conveyance from Donaldson, the plaintiff had the better title, and the charge was correct. This question will now be examined. It is obvious, that to attribute to the registration in Hawkins county the  ffect here contended for, it is necessary, 1. To attach to the provisions of the 5th section of the act of 1788, a variety of incidents, and to give it fi latitude of construction which nothing but the unequivocal intent of the Legislature could countenance. The word land must be taken to mean muniments of title   the word grant, both patents and mesne conveyances  and words of enactment, which, in their direct and ordinary signification, are solely imperative, must be considered as importing a privilege or exemption. Besides which, all the provisions of the 5th section of the act of 1715, must be incorporated with the 5th section of that of 1788, in order to sustain the implication, th t recording in Hawkins county shall make the one valid, or the failure to record in that place be fatal to the other. This view of the subject would lead to a protracted and subtle discussion, which the conclusions of this Court on other points, render now unnecessary to b.e pursued   and . the subject is only noticed, to avoid the implication, that this Court has acquiesced in such a construction of the clause in question. 2. To give effect to the.registration in Hawkins county, it is also obvious, that the 5th section of the act of 1788 must have continued in force until 1797, when the deed, to Allison was recorded in that county. And this must either be. inferred. from the words of the section itself, or must be the effect of the subsequent reviving acts. In their ordinary and direct signification, the words of the section in question certainly import perpetuity  and did it stand alone, such would be the effect given to it, whether in its operation it be considered imperative or remedial. But the context necessarily limits its duration. Both the title and preamble of the act, declare it to be' to relieve persons, who would be sufferers from neglecting to record their muniments of title in due time. And it would be hard to conceive, a reason why grants and mesne conveyances elsewhere, should be forced upon record within a limited time, and those for lands in this district of country left without limitation as to time. While there was no office assigned for their registration, a reason existed   but that reasonis taken away, when we admit that a proper office was opened for that purpose. The question,, however, does not rest herq   a recording law, unlimited in point of tim , and unaffected by penalties, is an absurdity, since it destroys its own views, when it leaves the individual . at large, to record or not, as he ple ses. And if an additional proof be wanting, to indicate the sense of the Legislature in passing this section of the act of 1788, it is to be found in the reviving act of North Carolina, of 1790, in which it is expressly declared, that the act of 1788 would expire, if not then revived. The idea, therefore, of its being perpetual, in its own provisions, is rejected   and it remains.to inquire, whether it was continued in force up to 1797, when the deed to Allison was recorded in Hawkins county. This must depend upon the several reviving acts passed subsequent to 1788,. And it is perfectly clear, upon collating those acts, that the 5th section of the act of that year had expired, and was dropped, before Allison s deed was registered. In 1790, the State of North Carolina passed a law, reviving, for two years, the act of 1788, with all its provisions   but the State of Tennessee had previously been separated from North Carolina, and the provisions of the 5th section of the act of 1788, appear never to have been taken up in Tennessee. It is not necessary, in arriving at this conclusion, to examine whether the words of the section shall be restricted to grants, or extended to mesne conveyances, or whether to deeds prior or subsequent. In no point of view will this section sustain the re^ gistration   for the .deed is registered as a mesne conveyance, hot a grant, properly so called, and must take effect under those legal provisions which extend to mesne conveyances. The act which purports to reviv  the act of 1788, is that of Tennessee  of 1794  and by that, the right of recording out of the county where the land lies, is wholly dropped. The general words of the act of North Carolina, in 1790, are not . adopted   but the right of recording again, is explicitly brought back to the general policy of the country, that of recording titles in the county where the land lies. Th  question will, no doubt, here occur, whether the Legislature could have intended to impose this duty, while there was no county, and. no Court, in which such record could be made. The answer is, that the question is here immaterial, sinc<  it is enough for all the purposes of the defendant below, if the obligation to. record did not exist at all, until there was a county established   but were it otherwise, the only question here is, whether the provisions of the act of 1794, or any other act prior to 1797, revives the supposed right to record in Hawkins county  whether it grants a privilege, or imposes a duty, as to that particular county, and the right of recording in any other place than where the land lies. The act of 1796, which is that under the immediate protection of which it is necessary that Allison s deed should be sustained in favour of the plaintiff below, contains a simple revival of the act of 1794, without any farther provision. Its meaning and effect, therefore, must be read upon the face of the latter act. There were some other points made in. the argument, which, as the cause must be sent back, it if proper to notice. At one, if not two periods, of the early history of Tennessee, there occurred an interval of time, during which the suspending laws, as they are called, didjnot exist, and that of 1715, of course, operated upon all cases within it. Th t State passed from the jurisdiction of North Carolina in 1790, but its first territorial Legislature did not meet until 1794. By a provision of the act of separation, the laws of North Carolina became the laws of Tennessee, until repealed by the Legislative authority of the ceded teiritory, of, it is presumed, until they, ex-pir d by heir own limitations. Whether an hiatus- occur  d in these suspending laws, at the interval of time, is immaterial in this cause, since the junior deed did not come into existence until after the passage of (he act of 1794.' But between the sessions of-1800 and 1801,. there did occur a chasm, in these suspending laws, which chasm, the defendant in error contended in argument, put an end' to the interest claimed under the prior deed altogether. It is obvious, that this argument assumes for its basis the supposition, that the registration of his deed in Hawkins county was valid.and effectual to this purpose. The opinion has been expressed, that the 5th section of the act of 1788, was not in force at the time when that registration was made. And the Court now recurs to the subject, only -to avoid the imputation, of having admitted the conclusion in favour of the defendant in error, had:the registration in Hawkins county been made while the law was in force. We give no opinion on the operation of the act of 1715, on titles to those lands which were so situated that it was impossible for the provisions of the act of 1715 to be complied with   that is, those lands which- lay in' no designated county. In the present instance, the land in controversy was not included within a county line, until the year 1801. As both deeds were registered in the proper county, after the chasm occurred, they are both equally affected by it  and it has no bearing upon their interests, as made out  nder the registration where the land lies. Another point made in argument, was, that the defendant could not protect himself under the title to Adair, without connecting himself with it. Upon recurring to the words of the charge, we find' it to be, that the plaintiff below had the better title. From this, an inference undoubtedly arises, that if the defendant below had exhibited a better title, the plaintiff could not recover, even though the defendant did not show that better title to be transmitted to himself. Since the registration in the county where the land lies, and which is the only registration deemed valid in this cause, gave the prior registration to the prior deed, and thus took away every claim to precedence from the deed under which the plaintiff below made title, the Court must be adjudged to have erred in its charge upon that subject. On the implied proposition, that the better title might be set up, as a shield against the plaintiff s recovery in ejectment, even though the defendant does not show that better title in himself, we will limit ourselves to the following, remarks : The rule of law, that a plaintiff must recover by the strength of his own title, and not the weakness of his adversary s, must be limited and explained by the nature of each case as it arises. Since the ride is univ rsal, that a plaintiff in ejectment must show the right to possession to be in himself positively, and it is immaterial as to his right of recovery, whether it be out of the tenant or not, if it be not in himself, if follows that a .tenant is always, at liberty to prove the title out of  flic plaintiff, although he does riot prove it to exist in himself. Possible difficulties may be suggested as to the application of this principle to mere tort feasors or forcible disseisors  but besides- that such cases, being  generally provided for under statutes of forcible entry, must be of rare occurrence, it is time enough, when $hey occur, to consider what exceptions they present to the general principle. The last point proper to be noticed, is that made in the former argument, on the question of revocation of the power of attorney under which the junior deed was executed. This was supposed to. be virtually revoked by the prior conveyance of the same .land, executed by Donaldson, who gave the power. And this, on general principles, is unquestionably correct. Whatever liabilities, for damages or otherwise, Donaldson might have incurred by not revoking the power by due notice, it is unquestionable, that a power must cease and determine  when there is nothing left for it to act upon. It will be seen, however, that this question resolves itself into the principal question in the cause, to wit, whether the first deed ever was a subsisting valid conveyance. If it was not, then the ground of the argument fails, for the estate had not, in effect, ever passed out of Donaldson  and if it was, then its effect is complete, without recurring to the ground of revocation.. Judgment reversed.. Judgment. This cause came on to be heard, &c. On consideration whereof, this Court .is of opinion, that the said Circuit Court erred in instructing the jury   that the lessor of the plaintiff' had the better title to the land in controversy.  It is, therefore, adjudged and ordered, that the judgment of the said Circuit Court in this case be, and the same is hereby reversed and annulled: and it is further ordered, that said cause be remanded to the said Circuit Court, with instruction's to issue -a venire facias de novo. attorneys:  This cause was argued by Mr. Eaton, fer the Hdtrzsa. plaintiff in error, and Mr. Harper, for the defendant in error. corrections:  head_matter: [Locaii Law.1 Love, Plaintiff in Error, v.

      "judges:   parties:  RULE S LESSEE v. PARKER. opinions:  By the Court. This is a proceeding by which a man s property is to be taken from him without the interference of a court, and not in the common course of law. It is a summary and an extraordinary proceeding. Whoever claims title under it must show that he has complied with all the requisites which the law has prescribed in order to guard against fraud and imposition. The advertisements required by the Act to precede a sale, ought to be proved to have been made, so as to satisfy a jury that they were made. Circumstances indicative of the fact may be received at this distance of time   and some such circumstances have been given in evidence in the present case, such as the production of one Gazette in which the advertisement appears. But there is one objection which the Court deems fatal. The surveyor s book describes the land and its situation, and states Grant to be the reputed owner. The collector s book states him to be the occupier or possessor, and it is proved that Grant lived in Kentucky. Had it appeared upon the collector s book that he was only the reputed owner, there would have been a publication as directed by the Act of 1798, ch. 92,   11, as well as the publication required by the 18th section. It is indeed argued, by the counsel for the defendant that the publication is only requisite in the case of an unknown person, whose personal property is intended to be seized by the collector for raising the taxes due, and is only preparatory to such seizure. I am of opinion, however, that it is equally necessary in the case of a person who is known, but is the resident of another State or country   and' that, in the case of an absentee, both advertisements are necessary, as directed by the 11th and 12th sections of the Act of 1798. As to the objection that a demand by the collector ought to have preceded the sale, that could not be, for the reputed owner was not in the collection district. Nor does the Court perceive the weight of the objection as to sending a statement of the taxes due to the collector of the district where Grant resided. The district spoken of in the Act meant one in the State, and under the care and superintendence of the same supervisor as the district from whence it must be sent. Whit side, for the plaintiff.

      "Choice 1:\n",
      "judges:   parties:  Mary Ronkendorff, Plaintiff in Error vs. James N. Taylor s Lessee, Defendant in Error opinions:  Mr Justice M Lean delivered the opinion of the Court. This writ, of error is prosecuted to reverse.a judgment of the circuit court for the district of Columbia. The defendant in error brought an action of ejectment in the circuit court, to r cover possession of lot No. 4, ip square No. 491, in the city of Washington, half of which had been sold for taxes  and under the special instructions of the court,-recovered   verdict and judgment. Several exceptions were taken to the competency of the evidence admitted on the trial, all of which appear in the bill of exceptions. The first objection was taken to the competency of the proof of the assessment-of the lot-for taxation: the legality-of the tax is not disputed. To show the taxes assessed on the lot for the years 1820 and 1821, the defendant below produced in evidence the' official tax books of the corporation, regularly made up by its officers  from which it appeared, that th  plaintiff stood charged for 1820, with thirty-one dollars- eighty-six cents for. the tax on the . half, of lot No. 4, which contained four thousand two hundred and two square feet, valued at one thousand six hundred and eighty dollars. For the year 1821, he stood charged with eight dollars forty cents tax on the same lot. It appeared in proof, that the assessors appointed by the authority of the corporation, make a valuation of .property within the city, about the month of October, annually, and a return of their proceedings  which are laid' before the board of appeal empowered to correct the valuations of the assessors, according to the laws and ordinances of the corporation. The assessment' lists are then returned to the register of the corporation. The register then proceeds to make out the tax books, from the original assessment lists returned by the assessors, and corrected by the board of appeal. But it was contended, that the original lists of the assessors must be. produced, and also proof of their appointment. The court recognize the correctness of the principle contended for by the counsel for tho.plaintiff in error  that in an ex parte proceeding of this kind, under a special authority, great strictness is required. To divest an individual of his property, against his consent, every substantial requisite of the law must be shown to have been complied with. No presumption can be raised in behalf of a collector who sells real estate for taxes, to cover any radical defect in his proceeding  and ihe proof of regularity in the procedure devolves upon the person who claims under the collector s sale. In this case, was it necessary to exhibit proof of the regular appointment, of the assessors ? They acted under the authority of the corporation, and the highest evidence of this fact is the sanction which it has given to their return. This return has been examined and .corrected by the board of appeal, and was then handed over to the register, \\yhat better proof can be required of the assessor s authority to act. The municipal powers of the corporation are conferred by apublic law, and all courts are bound to notice them. Is it necessary.in any case to go into the proof of the election of the mayor, or any of the other officers of this corporation? This has not been contended  nor can it be necessary to ..prove the appointment of an officer of the corporation, who has. acted under its authority, and whose proceedings, as in the present case, have received its express sanction. Did the court below err in requiring tho original assessment lists to be produced. These lists, under the law, were not  Conclusive on the corporation, or on the person whose property was assessed. They were laid before the court of appeal for their correction and sanction, and they were then passed to the register. If the assessment was not conclusive, or indeed binding on either party until.sanctioned by the board of appeal  t ten, without this sanction, the assessment lists could not be received as evidence. These lists being handed over to the register, the law requires him to furnish a tax book to the collector, from the original assessment lists on file in his office, according to a prescribed form. -This was done in the case under consideration   and is-not this book evidence ? It was made out and arranged by an officer, in pursuance of a duty expressly enjoined by law. This not only makes the tax book evidence, but the best evidence which can be given of the facts it contains. In this book are stated, the name of the owner of the. property, and his residence,,if known   the number of the square, the number of the lot, the square feet it contains  the rate of assessment, the valuation, and the amount of the tax. Only a part of these appear Upon the assessment list. This court think, 'that-the circuit court arred in their instructions to the jury on both of the, points stated. 1. In deciding that the proof was not competent to show the authority of the assessorsand, -2. That the official tax book, certified by the register, did not prove an assessment of the property. The next point presented by .the bill of exceptions is as to the legality of the notice of sale given by the collector.  Th'e court instructed fhe jury, that the advertisement was defective in several particulars. By the tenth section of the apt of congress, which directs-this proceeding  , the collector is required to give public notice of the time and place, of sale, by advertising once a week, in.some newspaper printed in the city of Washington , for thr.ee months   when the property is assessed to a person who .resides within'the United. States, but without the district of Columbia. Notice of the sale.of the lot in controversy was given by .the collector  first  in a newspaper published the 6th of.December 1822, and last, in the same paper of the 10th of March 1823. These periods, embrace the time the advertisement is required to be publish d: but it is contended, that  the notice was not published once in each week, within the meaning of the act of congress.   In examining the dates of the publications, it appears that eleven days at one time transpired between them, and at another time'ten days, at another eight. These:'omissions, it is contended, are fatal: that the publication being once made, it was essential to the validity of the notice that- it should be published every seventh day thereafter. The words of the law are,  oncea week.  Does this limit the publication to a particular day of the week1? If the notice be published on Monday, is it fatal to omit the publication until the Tuesday week succeeding ^ The object of the notice is as well answered by such a publication,, as if' it had been made on the following Monday. A week is. a definite period of time, commencing on Sunday and ending on Saturday. By this construction the no, tice in this case must be held sufficient. It was published, Monday, January the' 6th, and omitted until Saturday, January the 18th, leaving an interval of eleven days  still the . publication on Saturday was within the week succeeding the notice of the sixth. It would be a most rigid construction of the act of congress,, justified neither by its spirit nor its language, to say that this notice must-be published on.a y particular day of a week. If published once a week, for three months, the law is complied with, and its object effectuated. The circuit court erred on this point in their instructions to the-jury. The court below also instructed the jury,   that the corporation, or its collector of taxes, acting under its authority, was not competent to advertise and sell.any part of said lot No. 4, for the taxes assessed on the same.  By the law, not less than a lot, when the property upon which the tax has accrued is hot less than that quantity, may be sold for the taxes due thereon. No doubt-can exist, that a part of a lot may be sold for taxes, where they have accrued on such part - it appears, therefore, that the circuit court have also erred on this point. It is again objected,   that the entire lot should have been assessed to the two tenants in common, Taylor and Toland  and accordingly advertised and sold, as assessed to them.   The same valuation was placed on each half of .this lot  so that so far as the assessment goes, it did not substantially differ from the instruction given. But the sal ,_to be valid, need not extend to the interest of both claimants. One having paid his share of the tax, the interest of the other may well be sold for the balance. The court therefore erred in their instructions on this point also. In their fourth instruction the court say to the jury,   that the advertisement did not sufficiently designate what half of the said lot was charged with the said taxes, and was to be sold for the same, and did not purport to be an advertisem ntof an undivided moiety.   The law requires  the number of the lots, (if the square has been divided into lots,.) the number,of the square or squares, or other sufficient of definite description of the property selected for sale, to be stated in the advertisement.  Congress had two objects in view in requiring this notice to be given. 1. To apprise the owner of the property  and, 2. To give notice to persons desirous of purchasing. These objects are important. It is necessary for the interest of the owner that he should be informed of a proceeding which, unless arrested by the payment of lh e tax, would divest him of his property. And it was of equal, if not greater importance, that the property should be so definitely described, that- no purchaser could be at a loss to estimate its value. It is not sufficient that such a description should be given in the advertisement as would enable the person desirous of .purchasing to ascertain the .. tuation Of the property by inquiry. Nor, if the purchaser at the sale had been informed of every fact ne'cessary to enable him to fix a value upon the property   yet the sale would be void, unless the same information had been communicated to the public in the notice. Its defects, if any exist in the description of the property to be sold, cannot be cured by any communication made to bidders on the day of sale by the auctioneer. What was the description given in the advertisement of the property in controversy 1 It was described to be half of lot No. 4, in square No. 491  and the other half was advertised at the same time under the same description, as belonging to Toland s heirs. What would be understood by such a description. Suppose half a square had been advertised, it not having been divided into lots: would it convey .that certainty to the public, as to the precise property about to be sold, that would enable any one to form an opinion of its value % No one could suppose that an undivided half of the square was to be sold Under the notice  and which half was offered, could .not be determined from the advertisement. Would this be a notice under the requisites of the law ? The value of a lot or half lot depends upon its situation. If one of the half lots front two streets in a populous part of the city, it is of much higher value than the other half. And  this difference in value may still be greater, if the lot be situated near the middle of a square, fronting the street, and it be divided so as to cut off one half of it from the street. It will thus be seen, that it is not a matter of small importance to the person who wishes to purchase, to know which half of a lot is offered for sale  and as any uncertainty in this matter must materially affect the value of the property at the sale, it is of great importance to the owner that the description should be definite. That an undivided moiety of a lot may be sold for taxes, has already been stated. But would any one understand that one half of lot No. 4 means an undivided moiety In all cities half lots are as common as whole ones  and when a half lot is spoken of, we understand it to be a piece of ground half the size of an entire lot, and of as definite boundaries. The illustrations given show how great a difference in value may exist between halves of the same lot. And would not the preferable half be of much higher value than an undivided moiety of the entire lot % In every point of view in which this notice can be considered, under the act of congress, it was radically defective. The property should have been described, as an undivided half of lot No. 4. Under such a description, no one could be at a loss, as to its situation and value. The instructions of the circuit court on this point are. not erroneous. In their fifth instruction the court say,  that the corpo-. ration, or its collector, had-no power or authority to advertise the said lot for sale till the last of the two years  taxes for which the same was adv rtised for sale, had remained unpaid and in arrear for two years.   The tenth section of the act of congress, which governs this subject, provides,   that real property, whether improved or unimproved, in the city of Washington, on which two or more years  taxes shall have remained due and unpaid  pr on which any special tax, imposed by virtue' of the authority of the provisions of this acjt, shall have remained unpaid for two or more years after  the same shall have become due, may be sold, &c.  In this section, a distinction is made between a general and a special tax. Property may be sold to. pay the former, so soon as two years  taxes shall be due  but to pay the latter, property cannot b  sold until the expiration of two years after the second year s tax-becomes due. The taxes for which theiot in controversy was sold, were assessed in 1820 and 1821  and by the ordinance of the corporation they became due on the 1st of. January succeeding the assessment. A special tax for. paving was charged against Taylor in 1820, and composed a part of the sum for which the property was sold. This special tax became due on the 1st of January 1821 . but the ground on which it was assessed, was not liable to be sold for the tax until the 1st of January 1823. On the 1st of January 1822 the same property was liable to.be sold under -the assessments of the years-1820 and 1821, for a general tax: The first notice of the sale'was given on the 6th of December 1822, nearly a moiith before the lot. was liable to be sold for the special tax of 1820. Does this render the notice invalid % This court think, that the whole period should have elapsed which was necessary to render the lot liable to be sold for special tax, before the advertisement was published. That the owner of the lot, hf paying the tax at any time before the 1st of January 1823, would save it .from die liability of being sold - and that until this liability had attached, .he could not be chargeable with-the expense of notice, nor could it legally be given. The circuit court, therefore, did not err in their instruction to the jury on this point. The court also instructed the jury, that the advertisement was defective, as it   does not purport to advertise the said lot for two years  taxes unpaid and in arrear.  It states that the lot was offered for sale,   for taxes due thereon up to the year 1821.  This was sufficient  for if the taxes were due, and the property Was liable to be sold for them, it can be of no importance tO\\ the purchaser to have a more technical description of the tax than the notice contained. The seventh instruction,   that the said property, attempted to be sold, was not described with Sufficient certainty either in the advertisement or at the sale,  is substantially embraced by the fourth instruction which has been considered. For the errors specified, the judgment of the circuit court must be reversed, and the cause removed to that court for further proceedings, in conformity to this opinion. This cause came on to be heard on the transcript of the record from the circuit court of the United States, for the district of Columbia, holden in and for the county'of Washington, and was argued by counsel  on consideration whereof, it is ordered and adjudged by this court, that the judgment of the said circuit court in this cause be, and the same is hereby reversed, and that the cause be and the same is hereby, remanded to the said circuit court, for further proceed ings to be had therein, according to law and justice. attorneys:  The case was argued by Mr Jones for the plaintiff in error  and by Mr Barrell and Mr Key for the defendant.    Mr Jones, for the plaintiff in error,    Mr Barrell and Mr Key, for the defendant,    Mr Jones, in reply, corrections:  head_matter: Mary Ronkendorff, Plaintiff in Error vs. James N. Taylor s Lessee, Defendant in Error The official fax books of (he corporation of Washington, made up by the register from the original returns  r lists of the assessors laid before the court of appeals, he being empowered by the ordinances of the corporation to correct the valuations made by the assessors, are evidence   and it is-'not required that the -assessor s original lists shall be produced in evidence, to prove the.assessment of the taxes on real estate in the city of Washington. [369]   In an ex parte proceeding, as a sale of land for taxes under a special authority, great strictness is required. To divest an individual of his property against his consent, every substantial requisite of the law must -be complied with. No presumption can be raised.in behalf pf a collector who sells real estate for'taxes to cure any radical defect in his proceedings  and the proof of regularity devolves upon the person who Claims under the collector s sale. [359]   Proof of the regular appointment of the assessors is not necessary. They acted under the authority of the corporation, and the highest evidence-of this feet is the sanction given to their retu'rns. [360], The act of congress, under which ,the lot' in. the city of Washington ift controversy was sold, required that public notice of the time and place of sale of lots, the property ot non-residents, should be given b.y Advertising   once a week  in some newspaper in the city, for three months. Notice of the sale of the lot in controversy was published for three months  but jn the course of that period, eleven days at one time, at another ten days, and at another eight days transpired, in succeeding weeks  between the insertions of the adCerlisemenUn the newspapers.' -** A week  is a definite peiiod oT time, commencing on Sunday and ending on Saturday. The notice was published, Monday, January 6(b, and .was omitted until Saturday, January I8tb, leaving an interval of eleven days. Still-th .publication on Saturday was within the week preceding the notice of' .the 6th   and this was sufficient.   It woujd be.a most rigid construction of the ant of congress, justified neither by its spirit.nor its language, to say that-this notice must be published on any'particular day-of a week. If published once a week fot three months, the law is complied with, and its object effectuated. [361] No doubt can exist' that a part of a lot may be sold for taxes, where they have accrued on such part. [361] _ The lot on which the taxes were assessed, belonged to two persons as tenants in. common. The assessment was made by a valuation of each half of the Tot. To make a sale of the interest of on,e tenant in common for unpaid taxes Valid, it need not extend td the interest of both claimants : one having paid his tax,the interest of the other may weli be sold for the balance. [361] The advertisement purported to sell   half of lot No. 4, in square No. 491   and the other half was advertised in the same manner, as belonging to the other tenant in commpn. This was nota sufficient advertisement  and a sale made under the same was void. [362] It is not sufficient that in an advertisement of land for sale for unpaid taxes, such a description is given as would enable the person desirous of purchasing to ascertain the situation of the property by inquiry  nor, if the purchaser at the sale had been informed of every fact necessary to enable him to fix a value up,on the property, would the sale be valid, unless the same information had been communicated to the public in the notice. [362] The tenth section of the act of congress provides that real property in Washington, on which two or more years  taxes shall be due and unpaid, may be sold, &e. In this section a'distinction is made between a general and a special tax. Property may be sold to pay the former'as-soon as two years  taxes shall be due  but to pay the,latter, property cannot be sold until the expiration of two years after the second-year s tax becomes due. The taxes for which the property in controversy was sold, became due, by the ordinance of the corporation, on the 1st day of January 1821 and 1822. The special tax for paving was charged against the lot in 1820, and became due on the 1st of January 1821  but the ground on which it was assessed was not liable to be sold for the tax until tbe 1st of January 1823. The first notice of the sale was given on the 6th of December 1822, nearly a month before the lot was liable to be sold for the special tax of 1820. Meld, that the whole period should have elapsed which was necessary to render the lot liable to be sold for the special tax, before the advertisement was published. [364] FROM the circuit court of the district of Columbia, for the county of Washington. This.was. an ejectment, brought by the defendant in error, in the circuit court, for the recovery of an undivided moiety of a, lot of ground in the city of Washington, No. 4, in square No. 491. The lessor of the plaintiff in the. ejectment claimed to be entitled, to the lot .of ground as tenant in common with the heirs at law of Henry Toland, deceased  and on the 10th of March 1823, the half of the lot so held by the lessor of the plaintiff, was set up and exposed to-publie sale, as assessed to James N. Taylor, for taxes due to the corporation of Washington, for the years 1820 and 1821, amounting,-in the whole, including- the expenses of the sale, to the :sum of forty-seven doll rs and ninety-one cents  and Henry T. Weightrnan became the purchaser of the same. MaryRonk ndorff^ the plaintiff in error, holds, as lessee, tinder the purchase at the tax sale. in the circuit court the jury returned   verdict for. the plaintiff in the ejectment  upon which judgment for his unexpired term in an undivided,  moiety of the lot as tenant in common was rendered'in his favour, under the instructions qf the court  to. which several exceptions were taken. The plaintiff in the circuit court made out his title under the commissioners of the city'of Washington, by regular conveyances to himself and Henry Toland deceased  and it was agreed that the plaintiff s lessee and Toland s heirs were under the same, seised in fee as tenants in common of the premises, before the sale  f the half lot for taxes  The defendant proved the assessment of the taxes on the lot, by the production of the-regular evidence, and that the taxes were assessed and the assessments were entered in the tax books, according to the forms usually pursued and authorised under the charter and ordinances of the corporation of Washington. In the tax book of 1820, the assessment of lot No. 4, in square No. 491, appears arranged in columns in the established and accustomed forms   in which are placed the name and residence of the owner of the property   the number of the square  the number of the lot  its contents in square feet  the rate of assessment  the valuation   the valuation of the improvements  and the amount of the tax.. The lot in controversy was entered in the tax book of 1820 thus : In the tax book for 1821, the assessments of the lot were entered as follows: It was also proved, on the part of the defendant in the ejectment, that the persons appointed to take the value of the property liable to assessments. for taxes in the city of Washington, usually perform the duty in October in each year, and make out annual lists. of the same and of-it  assessed value   which, after being laid before the board of ap> peal empowered to correct the valuations, are .returned to tlie-register, of the.'cor-poration,.'wilh the corrections, i'f  ny, in Whose custody and-office the-original books containing such lists and valuations are preserved ,-and the   register, by. the- authority of.the corporation, then proceeds to digest the tax books, year by year, in. the form described, and tr-ansferSiinto auch tax books, from the original assessment books set returned by theassessor.s, through-th.e board of appeal, the lists Of theseveral species, descriptions and parcels of property on which such taxes are imposed, and .the. assessed valuation ot me. same, as corrected  by the board of appeal  extending in the-proper column-prepared for the. purpose, the amount of the taxes imposed Upon th 'same respectively: which tax books, given in  videnc e by the defendant, were so made up and arranged by the register, in. the- years 1820 and 1821 respectively the general taxes- theyain respectively assessed becoming due and payable, according to the laws of the corporation, on the first-day of January of ,each year then next ensuing  that is to say, the general tax (exclusive Of the special, tax for paving) for the year 1820, cm. the 1st.of January 1821  and that for the'year 1821, on the 1st of January 1822. The court, on the motion of the plaintiff, instructed the jury'that the tax. books, so given in- evidence* by the defendant, were not competent evidence to prove the assessments  of the.lot,for the years 1820 and 1821, unless the defendant first proved theregular appointment and authority of the assessors -whose books and- returns were used in making up and arranging the tax books as aforesaid  and algo produced the original books so returned by' the assessors, through the board of appeal, in each year respectively  to which opinion: and instruction of the court- the defendant in the circuit, court, excepted. It was. further preyed on the part of the defendant, that the. Collector of. the taxesimposed by the corporation, in third and fourth wards,  who was authorised to advertise and sell all property in those wards liable to be sold by taxes, oh Mon-. day the 6th of December, in the year 1822, the taxes on the lot in controversy being unpaid, caused to be inserted in the National-Intelligencer, the following advertisement:  Will be sold, at public sale, on Monday the 10th of March next, at 10 o clock, A.M. at the. City Hall, the following described property, to satisfy the corporation of Washington city for taxes due thereon up to the year 1821 inclusive, with costs and .charges  unless previously paid to the subscriber, to wit: (and amongst others are the following.) This advertisement was repeated, and republished, by the direction of the collector  on the several days following: Friday, Dec mber 6th, 1822.   -Saturday, December 14th, 1822,  Monday, December 16th, 1822.

The tenth section of the act of congress of the 15th May 1820j   to incorporate the inhabitants of the city of Washington, and to repeal all other acts heretofore passed,  requires that real estate upon which two years  taxes are unpaid and in arrear, shall be advertised   once a week  for three months. In pursuance of his authority and duty, and according to .the tenor of the advertisement, the collector, on the 10th of March 1823, set up at public sale one half of the lot No. 4, in square No. 491  and the same having been purchased by Henry T. 'Weightman, he paid the amount of the purchase money on the 11th of March 1823, to the collector, who thereupon executed and delivered to him a certificate under his hand, and executed in the presence of a witness  stating, that   at a sale made by me, as collector o,f taxes for the third and-fourth wards of the city of Washington, on the 10th of March 1823, after due notice given as required by the acts of the corporation of said city, I set up and exposed to public  sale, half of lot No. 4, in square No. 491, assessed to James N. Taylor, for faxes due the said corporation on the same, for the years 1820 and 1821, arhounting in the whole, including the expenses .of sale, to the. sum of forty-seven dollars and ninety-one cents  when a certain Henry- T. Weightman, being the highest bidder, became the purchaser thereof, at and for the sum of forty-seven dollars and  inety- ne cents: the receipt of' forty-seven dollars and ninety-one cents is hereby acknowledged, subject however to redemption as provided for by law. The collector made a return of the sale in the following form: Mr Weightman entered upon the half lot so sold to him, and was possessed thereof more-than two years after the day of sale  and afterwards, on the 5th. of October 1826, received. in  due form a conveyance in fee simple of the' said half lot, whieh deed was duly recorded: the plaintiff s lessor, James N. Taylor, or any person for him or in his behalf,-or any person whatever, not having at any time paid or in any manner tendered to Mr Weightman, or deposited in the hands, of the mayor or other officer of the corporation, the money paid to the collector, or any part thereof. - The court, on the motion of the plaintiff, Instructed the jury, that the advertisement of the propetty was defective and illegal in the several instances.and particulars following, to wit  1. That, being published and republished as aforesaid, on the several days aforesaid, from the 6th of December 1822 to the lTth of March 1823,both inclusive, was notan advertisement   once a week  for three months, within the. meaning of the tenth section of the act of congress, passed on the 15th of May 1^20,  to incorporate the inhabitants of the city of Washington, and to repeal all acts heretofore passed for that purpose.  2. That the said corporation, or its collector of taxes acting under its authority, was not competent to advertise and sell any part of the said lot No. 4, in square No. 491, less than the entire lot, for the taxes so assessed on the same and due to the said corporation. 3. That the entire lot should have been assessed to the two tenants in common, Taylor and Toland  and accordingly advertised android, as assessed to them. 4. That the said advertisement did not sufficiently designate what half of the said lot was charged with the said taxes, and was to be sold for the same  and did not purport to be. an .advertisement of an undivided moiety of the same for sale.- 5. That the said corporation or its said collector had no power or authority to advertise the said lot for sale, till the last of the two years  taxes, for which the same was advertised for sale, had remained unpaid and in arrears for two years. 6. That the said advertisement does not purport to advertise the said lot for two years  taxes unpaid and in arrears. 7. That the said property so attempted to be sold, was not described with sufficient certainty, either in the advertisement or at the sale. For which several defects, in the process of the. assessment, advertisement and sale of the said lot, the said sale is illegal and void. The defendant excepted to all these instructions and opinions of the court, and prosecuted this writ of error. The case was argued by Mr Jones for the plaintiff in error  and by Mr Barrell and Mr Key for the defendant. Mr Jones, for the plaintiff in error, contended  that the objections to the sale, which had been made for taxes, of the moiety of the lot, were untenable. The taxes for which the sale had been made, had bee. regularly assessed under the authority of the corporation of Washington, and in conformity to law   all the forms of the law and ordinances had been complied with in this, ussess'ment  the registering of the taxes  the advertisement  and the sale. He cited the charter and ordinances of the corporation in support of that position. Mr Barrell and Mr Key, for the defendant, contended  that no proof had been made on the trial in the circuit court of the assessment of the taxes. The original books of the assessors should have been produced  and. not the statements or abstracts from them made by the register. There may have been alterations made on appeals, and the original books of ..the assessors were the only legal evidence. Laws, for the sale bf lands for taxes should be construed strictly, and their provisions should be strictly pursued. They are penal in their nature and effects. They go to wrest the property of the owner out of his hands by act of law  and every form which the law directs must be entirely and fully answered. 8 Wheat. 682. The description of the property was imperfect, it did not designate the part of the lot to be sold with sufficient, if with any precision. If the corporation could divide a lot, which is denied, in order to comply with the law, there should have been an assessment of- \\ half lot, and a description of it as such. To show that such a description was insufficient, cited, I Har. & Gill, 172. The publication of the advertisement was not made in conformity with the provisions of the charter  The tenth section'directs that the advertisement shall be inserted once a week, for three months  but the case shows that this was not done. A period of twelve days had elapsed between the days on which the advertisement appeared  and no more seven days should have passed. Once a week means once in every seven days  from one day, a particular day, to another, a corresponding- day in the succeeding week. In every period of seven days, the insertion, of the notice was not sufficient. If the advertisement commenced on one day in a week, it should have been repeated on the following corresponding day in the succeeding week  and so. on,until it had- been inserted for three .months.. The stipulation to pay rent quarterly, and. the construction given to such covenants  illustrate and explain the positipn-of the defendant in error. Would it be a compliance with an agreement to pay two quarters rent, quarterly, to make the payment at any time within sii months, being two quarters? The payments are to be made under such covenant from quarter-day to quarter-day  and there is a breach, if the corresponding and succeeding quarter-day is suffered to pass without payment being made. It was  lso.contended  that the corporation had no authority to advertise the lot for sale until the last of the. two years  taxes were due, for which the sale was to be made  and that the advertisement does not purport to expose the property to be sold for two years  taxes unpaid, and in arrears. Mr Jones, in reply, argued, that the book&pf the assessors were not the original records of the assessment of the taxes. The returns are-made to the register, and.are entered by him  and his books exhibit regular and proper evidence of the charges' and assessments on property in the city. The register is a public, sworn officer  and the duties he performs ar  official acts, which are shown by his books.   The advertisement was inserted in every succeeding period of, seven days, and this was a compliance with the law. It was a publication in every succeeding week, or space of seven days  and this was according to the letter of the charter. When a term is fixed for the performance of  n act, the whole time is allowed 10 do it  even to the last minute. So, to require advertising once a week, gives all the next week for the next advertising. On what succeeding day in the hebdomadal division of a week the advertisement shalL appear, is not required  the pame of the dpy of the week on. which it must be published is of no moment  as the names of the days of the week are arbitrary. It is the period of seven days, which the law regards as the space of a week  and in this case,'as there was no period of fourteen days in which the notice of the sale was omitted, no longer period than twelve days having passed during the three months'in vtfhich the advertisement did not appear, all was regular. As to the objection that the property sold had not been sufficiently described  as the powers of the corporation are to tax all interests in lands, the right to assess the. tax on an undivided moiety of a tenant in common cannot be denied. Such was this case  and the advertisement described sufficiently an undivided half of the lot, of which Taylor was the owner with Toland s heirs.\n",
      "Choice 2:\n",
      "judges:   parties:  Robinson v. Campbell. opinions:  Mr. Justice Todd- delivered the opinion of the-court, and-after stating the facts,^proceeded as follows  The,first question is, whether -the'circuit court were right in rejecting the- evidence, offered by the defendant establish a title in himself under the grant of Joseph? that grant being'posterior in date to the grant-under which the plaintiff claimed  and this depends up- .... . , . , on the consideration, whether a prior settlement right, would, in equity, give the party   title to the*anc^ 03n be asserted also, as-a sufficient title in an actjan of ejectment. ' _ , By the compact settling the boundary line Between' and Tennessee, and the- laws- made in par-suance thereof, it is declared, that all claims and titles*to lands derived from the governments of Virginia, or North-Carolina, or Tennessee, -which have fallen into- * % * respective states  shall reman  as secure to he owners thereof, as if derived from the government ^thin whose line they have fallen  and shall not be? in any wise prejudiced or affect d in consequence of the establishment of the said line. The titles, both of the plaintiff and defendant in this case, were derived under grants- from Virginia   and'the argument is, that as in Virginia no equitable claims-or rights ante-  cedent to the grants, could be asserted, kva court-o  law in an 1 ejectment, but were matters cognizable-in equity only, that the. rule must, under the compact between the two states, apply to all the suits inihecburts in Tennessee, respecting the lands included an those grants. Remedies, in respect to real are according*11 to the lex loci jd sitos.     The general rule is, that remedies m respect to real , , , estates are t  be pursued according to the law of place where the estate is situate. Nor do the court perceive any. reason to suppose that it was the intention of the legislature of either state, in the acts before'us, to vary the application of the rule in cases within the compact. Those acts are satisfied by construing them to.give the same validity and effect to.the titles acquired in-the disputed territory, as they, had, or would have,, in the state by which,they were granted, leaving the remedies to enforce such titles to he regulated by the lex.foni. The doctrine of the state courts of Tennessee,permitting an equitable title to be assented in an action at law, only applies to cases within the express purview of the Matutes of   Tennessee. The question- then is, .whether in the circuit, courts of the United States^ a merely equitable title can be set up  s a defence in an action of ejectment. It is understood that the state courts of Tennessee have decided that under their statutes, declaring an elder grant founded on a younger entry, to be void, tn  priority of entries is examinable at law  and that a junior patent founded on a prior entry, shall prevail in an ac- ion of ejectment against a senior patent founded on a junior entry. But this doctrine has never been extended beyond the cases which have been construed to be within the express purview of the statut s of Tennessee. The present case stands upon grants of Virginia, and is not within the'purview of the statutes of Tennessee  the titles have all their validity firom the laws of Virginia', and are confirmed by the stipulations of the compact: Assuming, therefore, that in the case of entries under the laws of Tennessee, the priority of such entries is examinable at. law, this court do not think that the doctrine applies to merely equitable rights derived from other sources.    ourts  f the United States at com* mon law and to be  not act00j-h  ^ut^Lcwding to the principlesof common lawande^uity England!Thhi conciled  with decisions of the courts of Tennessee, equUab!eStUl  inanacUon'at There is a more general view of this subject, which deserves consideration.   By the laws of the United 1 f J   Slates, the circuit courts have cognizanoe of all suits of a civil nature at common law, and in equity, incases which fall within the limits prescribed by those laws. By the 24th section of the judiciary act of 1789, it is pro vided, that the laws of the several States, except where , . . tt   , the constitution, treaties, or statutes ot the United States, shall otherwise require or provide, shall be r.egarded as rules of decision in trials at common law in the courts of the.United States, in cases where they . J * ply. The act of May, 1792, confirms the modes of proceeding then used in suits at common law in the courts of the United States, and declares that the modes tit proceeding in suits of equity, shall be  according to the p nciples,: rules, and usages which belong to courts Of equity, as contra-distinguished frorp courts of cbiaampn laW)  except so far as may have been provided for by the act to establish the judicial courts of the United States, It is material to consider whether it was the intention of Congress, by these provisions, to. confine the courts of the United States in their mode of administering relief to the same remedies, and those only, with all their incidents, which existed in the courts of the respective states. In other words, whether it was their intention to give the party relief at law, where the practice of the .state courts would give it, and relief tre equity only, when according to such practice, a plain, adequate, and complete remedy could not he had at law. In some states in the union, no court of chancery exists to administer equitable relief. In some of those states, courts of law recognise and enforce in suits at law, all the equitable claims and rights which a court of equity would recognise and enforce  in others, all relief is denied and such equitable claims and rights are to be considered as mere nullities at law. A construction, therefore, that would adopt the state practice in a its extent, would at once extinguish, in such states, the exercise of equitabl  jurisdiction. The acts of Congress have distinguished between remedies at common law and in equity, yet this construction would confound them. The court, therefore think, that to effectuate the purposes of the legislature,the remedies in the courts of the United States, are to be, at common law or in equity, not according to the practice of state courts, but according to the principles of common laW and equity, as distinguished and defined in that country from which we derive pur knowledge of those principles. Consistently with this construction, it may be admitted, tb t where by the statutes of a state, a title, which would otherwise be deemed merely equitable, is recognised as a legal title, or a title which would be good at law, is under circumstances of an equitable nature declared by such statutes to be void, the rights of the parties, in such case, may be as fully considered in a suit at law in the courts of the United States, as they ryould be in any stare court. In either view of this first point, the court is of opinion that the circuit court decided right in rejecting the evidence offered by the original defendant. It was matter proper for. the cognisance of a court of equity* and not admissible in a suit at law. The next question is, whether the circuit court decided correctly in rejecting the deed of conveyance from the plaintiff s lessor to Arthur L. Campbell, for the land in .controversy, made during the pendency of the suit. The answ r that was given at the bar is deemed decisive  although an action of ejectment is founded in fictions, yet to certain purposes it is considered in the same manner as if the whole proceedings were real  for all the purposes ot the suit the lease is to be deemed a real possessory title. Jf.it expire during the pendency of the suit, the plaintiff cannot recover his term at law, without procuring it to be enlarged by the court, and can proceed only for antecedent damages. In the present case the lease is to be deemed as a good subsisting lease, and the conveyance by the plaintiff s lessor during the pendency of the suit could not operate upon his reversionary interest, and, consequently, could not ex  tinguish the prior lease- The existence of such a leape is a fiction  but. it is upheld-for the purposes of justice, und there is no pretencethat it works any injustice m this case. tet o s*offTen nessee phcable to this ease. ^ast question is, whether the statute of limifaof Tennessee was a good bar to the action. It is .. , , , , admitted, that it would be.a good bar only upon the supposition that the . lands in controversy were always within the original limits of Tennessee  but there is no such proof in the cause. The compact of the states does not affirm it, and the present boundary was an amr ic.able adjustment by that compact. It cannot, the  e-fore, be affirmed by any court 'of law, that the land was within the' reach of the statute of limitations of Tennessee until after the compact of 1802. The statute could not begin to run until it was ascertained that the land wa  within the jurisdictional limits of the state of Tennessee. The judgment of the circuit court is affirmed, with costs. The foundations of this doctrine, and of all the other  principles concerning the lex foci, are laid down by Hubecus, in hi* Pmlectiofies, with that admirable force and pre<ci*ion which distinguish the   wprks of the writers who have been formed indie school of the Roman jurisconsults, and which justify the eulogium pronounced upon that school by Leibnitz.

Sed quare? See United States v. Crosby, 7 Cranch, 115 In Buller s Nisi Prius, 110, it is laid down, that in  ejectment,  if the defendant prove a title out of the lessor, it is sufficient, although he have no title himself  but he ought to prove a subsisting title out of the lessor, for producing an ancient lease for 1000 years will not be sufficient unless he likewise prove possession under such lease within twenty years.  The same doctrine is stated in Runnington on Ejectments, 343. and th  case of England v. Slade, 4 T. R. 682. is relied on to support it. But this c se only shows, that the tenant may prove that the lessor s tille has expired, and, therefore, that he ought not to turn him o,ut of possession. It is unquestionable law,that in ejectment  the plaintiff cannot recover 'but upon the strength of his own title. He cannot found his claim upon the weakness of the defendant s titl   for possession gives . the defendant a. right against every man who cannot show a good title.  Haldam v. Harvey, 4 Burr. 2484. S. P. Martin v. Troyonell, 5 T. R. 107. note. But this doctrine waS'asserted in a case where the plaintiffsought to recover upon a title which, she had conveyed away to a third person  and nothing can be clearer than that the plaintiff cannot recover without showing a subsisting title in-himself. Tf the position in Buller s Nisi Prius were confined to cases of this sort, diere could not be the slightest ground to question its validity But it is supposed to establish the doctrine, that if the plaintiff has a title which is not an indefeasihie possessory title, but is, in fact, better than that of the defendant he is not entitled to recover, if the defendant can , . ... .... show a superior title in a third person, with whom the defendant does not claim any privity.   It is the purposp of this note to show, that the authorities' do not justify the doctrine to this extent ' and if it be true in any case, (which maybe doubted,) it is liable to a great many exceptions, which destroy its general applicability. Speaking upon this subject Lord Mansfield is reported to have said,  there is another distinction to be taken,whether supposing a title superior to-that of the (essor of the plaintiff exists in a third person, who might recover the possession, it lies in thq mouth of the defendant to say sq, in answ r to an ejectment .brought against himself, by a party having a better title than his own. I found this point settled before I. came into this court, that tb ?, court never suffers a niorgagor to set up the tie of a third person against his morgagee.  Doe v. Pegge, 1 T. R. 758. note. The point as to a morgage,h^s been long established. In Lindsey v. Lindsey, Bull. N. P. 110. on an ejectmeht by a second morgagee against the morgagor, the court would not suffer the latter to give in evidence the   title of the .first morgagee in bar of the second, because he was Barred By his own act from averring that he had nothing in the land at the time of the second mortgage. And the principle of (his decision has been repeatedly recognised, both in the English and American courts. Doe v. Pegge, 1 T. R. 758. note. Doe v. Staple, 2 T. R. 684. Lade v. Holford, 3 Burr. 1416.

Lord Eldon has declared, that .with regard to' mortgagors and incumbrancers if they do not get in a term that is outstanding, but satisfied, in tome sense, either by taking an assignment making the trustee a party to the instrument, or taking possession of  the deed creating the term, that term-cannot be used    protect them against any person having mesnes charges or inOumbrances. Maundrell v. Maundrell, 10 Ves. 246. 271. See Peake's Evid. 341. 3d ed. And in cases where land has-been sold by executors or administrators under   legal authority to sell, it has been settled, that strangers to the title, those who have ho estate or privity of estate or interest, and who pretend to none, affected by the sale, shall not be entitled to set up the title of the heirs, or to call'on the executor or administrator for strict proof of the regularity of all bis proceedings in the sale. Knox v. Jenks, 7 Mass. Rep. 488. And a stranger to. a mortgage is not permitted to set it up to 'defeat a legal title in th  plaintiff. Collins v. Torrey, 7 Johns. Rep. 278. Jackson v. Pratt, 10 Johns. Rep. 381. These cases clearly show thatthe doctrine has been very  much narrowed' down. It remains to consider whether the doctrine has ever been.,established, that a mere .superior outstanding title in a third person, with whom the defendant has no privity, can be given in evidence in an ejectment, to defeat a possessory title in the plaintiff, which is superior to that of the defendant. It is manifest, that at the time when .Lord Mansfield delivered his opinion in Doe v. Pegge, (1 T. R. 758. note,) he did not consider any such doctrine as established, for he confines his opinion to the mere case of a mortgagee as against his mortgagor, although- he   states, the question in the broadest terms   and'if the de- . . , cisions had then gone the whole length,  he  would certainly have so stated. Nor is there ariy subsequent case in   England in which the point has been decided. The case of Doe v. Reade, 8 East. 353. tutned upon the circumstance that the defendant, being Jaw-'fully in possession, might defend 'himself upon his  title, though twenty years had run against him before he took possession, the plaintiff' in ejectment not claiming under  the prior adverse possession j and the case of Goodtitle v. Balwin, 11 East. 488. turned  pon the distinction, that the premises were Crown   lands,  which by statute could not be granted, and that the pos,session of the plaintiff and* .defendant was to be presumed by the license of the crown. Undoubtedly the' plaintiff ntust show that he has a good  possessory title  and, thelefore if the defendant shows that he has conveyed the land, unless, the conveyance was void by reason of a prior disseisin, the plaintiff cannot recover. Gould v. Newman, 6 Mass. Rep. 239. Wolcott v. Knight 6 Mass. Rep. 418. Everenden v. Beaumont, 7 Mass. Rep. 76. Williams v. Jackson, 5 Johns. Rep. 489. Phelps v. Sage, 2 Day's Rep. 151. So a tenant mayspow that the title of his landlord has expired. England v. Slade, 4 T. R. 682. So in an ejectment by a ccstvy que trust the tenant may setup in bis defence the legal oulstar ding title in the trustee. Doe v. Staples, 2 T. R. 684. For in all these cases the evidence shows that the plaintiff has no subsisting possessory title at law, and therefore, he ought not to be permitted to disturb the tenant s possession. The general rule is, that possession constitutes a sufficient title against every person not having a better title   and therefore the tenant may stand upon his mere naked possession until a better title is shown.  In sequali jure melior est  conditio possidentis   he that hath possession of lands, though it.be by disseisin  hath a right against alimen but against him that hath right.  Doct. & Stud. 9. 3 Shep. Abr. 26. and the rule -of the civil law is the same. Non possesserio-incurnbit neqessitas probandi possessionesadsepertinere, Cod.lib. 4 cited 2 Bro. Adm. & Civ. Law, 371. note. And possesssion, although it be 'merely a naked possession, or acquired by wrong, as by disseisen, is also a title upon which a re-   covery can be had. .For as Blackstone justly observes,   in   the mean time, till some 1 act be done by the rightful owner to-devest the possession and assert his title, such actual possession is -printa facie evidence,of a legal title in the possession   and it may, by length of time aud .negligence of him who hath the right, by degrees ripen into a perfect' and indefeasible title. 2 Bl. Com. 196. So Jenkins, in his -Centuries of Reports, (42.) states that the first possession without' any other title, serves in an assize for land. In Bateman v. Allen, Cro. Eliz. 437, it was held that the plaintiff was entitled to recover in ejectment where it was found by special verdict that the defendant had ' not the first pqssession, nor entered under title, but upon the plaintiff s possession. And in Allen v. Rivington, 2 Saun. R. 111, where, upon a special  verdict in ejectment, it appeared that the plaintiff had a priority ofpossession, and no title was found for the defendant, Saunders say's, the matter in law was never argued, fgr .the' priority of possession alone gives a good title to the lessor of the plaintiff against the defendant, and all the world, excepting against the rightful owner. And in a late case, it was held, that mere prior ocr cupancy of land, however recent, gives a good title to the occupier, whereupon he may recover, as plaintiff, againsf a l the world, except such as can prove an older and better title in themselves. Catteris v. Cooper, 4 Taunt. 547. See also, 8 East. 353. And this doctrine has been frequently recognized in the American courts. Jackson v. Hazen, 2 Johns. Rep. 22. Jackson v. Harder, 4 Johns. Rep. 202. The last case, 4 Johns. Rep. 202. goes farther, and decides that a mere intruder upon lands shall not be permitted to protect his intrusion in a suit by the person upon whom he has intruded, by setting up an outstanding title-in a stranger.' And in Smith v. Lorillard, 10 Johns. Rep. 338. all the authorities were reviewed, and it was held that if is not necessary fpr the plaintiffjn eject ment to show, in every case, a possession of twenty years, or a paper title   tfiat a possession for a less period will-form a presumption of title sufficient to put the tenant upon his defence   and that a prior possession short of twenty years, under a claim, or assertion of right, will prevail over a subsequent possession.of less than 20 years, when no other evidence of title appears on either side. -In respect to real actions, it is said by Chief Justice Parsons, that under the generalissuet he defendant cannot give in evidence a title under which he does not qlaim,unless it be to rebut the demandant s evidence .of seisin   but that may plead in bar a conveyance by thes demandant to a third person, under whom he does not claim   for iftenant have no right, yet if the demandant haVe no right, he cannot, in law, draw into question the tenant s seisin, whether acquired by right or ' by wrong, Wolcott v. Knight, 6 Mass. Rep. 418. Gould v. Mewman, 6 Mass. Rep. 239.   It is remarkable that in none of . the foregoing cases the point is stated to have been  ever decided upon the naked question whether a better subsisting title in a third person can1 be given in evidence by a defend ' dant who lias-no privity with that-title, to defeat a- i le in the plaintiff which is yet superior to thatund'er which the defendant holds the land. Blackstoneputs a case in point:  If tenant in tai.l enfeoffs A. in fee simpl  and dies, and B. disseizes A., nowi.B. will have the possession, A. the right.of fiossession, and the issue in tail the right of property.. A. tnay recover the possession against B. and after-wards the issue in tail may evict A., and unite in   himsfelf the possession, the right of possession, and also the right of property.  2 Bl. Com. 193. Here B. is an intruder, and, therefore, comes within the'reach of-the case of Jackson v. Harder, 4 Johns. Rep. 202. But if B. had conveyed to C., . and then A.,. had brought an ejectment against .C., could the latter have set up the title of the issue in tail, with which he had no privity ' although that were a good subsisting superior title to defeat the recovery of A.?

Robinson v. Campbell. the compact of  802, settling the boundary lina'between Virginia trait Tennessee, and the laws made in pursuance thereof, it is declared that  all claims and titles to lands derived, from Virginia, or North Cnrolbia, or Tennessee, which'have fallen into the respective states, shall remain as secure to the owners thereof, as if derived from the government within whose boundary (hey have fallen, and shall not be prejudiced'  pr affected by the establishment of the line. Where 'the titles,'both of the plaintiff and defendant in ejectment were derived under grant* from Virginia, to lands which fell within the limits of Tennessee, it was held that a prior settlement right thereto which would, in equity, give the party a title, could not:be asserted as a sufficient titlo in an action of ejectment brought in the circuit couit'of Tennessee. Although the state courts of Tennessee have decided, (hat under their statutes declaring an elder grant founded on a junior entry tobevoid, a junior patent founded on a prior entry, shall prevail at law against g senior.patent.'founded on a junior entry'  .this doctrine, has never been extended beyond cases within the express purview of the statute of Tennessee, and could not apply to the present case of titles deriving all their validity.from the laws of Virginia, and confirmed by the compact between the two states. The general rule is, that remedies in respect to real property ace to be - pursued according to the lex loci roi sit .

Conveyance by the plaintiffs lessor during the pendency of an action of ejectment, can only operate upon his reversionary interest, and cannot extinguish the prior lease. The -existence of such lease is a fie* tion: but it is upheld for tho purposes of justice. If it expire during ' the.pendency of a suit, the plaintiff cannot -recover his term at law, without procuring it tojre enlarged by the court, and can proceed only for antecedent damages. In the above case if was- held that the statute pf limitations of Tennes. see was not a good bar to the action, thera bping no proof that the land.3 in controversy were always within.the original limits of Tennessee, .and thostutute could not begin (o run until it was ascertained by thecpmpact of 1802.that the land fell within the jurisdictional tipi s of Tennessee. Error to the district court of East Tenessee. This was an action of ejectment brought by the defendant in error, (the plaintiff s lessor in the court below,) against the present plaintiff, and S'. Martin, on the 4th of February, 1807, in the district court for the district of East Tennese.e, which possessed circuit court powers. The d fendant in that court pleaded separately the. general issue, as to 400 acres, and disclaimed all fight to the residue of the tract specified in the declaration. A verdict was given for the plaintiff in October term, 1812. From the statement contaihed'in the bill of exceptions, taken' at the trial of the cause, it appears that the land for which the action was brought, is situated between two lines, run in 1779 I-y Walker and Henderson, as the boundary lines of Virginia and North Carolina^ The former state claimed jurisdiction to the line run by Walker, and the latter to the line run by Henderson. After the separation of Tennessee from North Carolina, the controversy between Virginia and Tennessee, as to boundary, was settled in 1802, by gunning a line equidistant from the former lines. The land in dispute fell within, the state of Tennessee. Both the litigant parties claimed under grants issued by the state of Virginia, the titles to lands derived from the said state having been protected by the act of Tennessee, passed in 1803 for the settlement of the boundary line. The plaintiff rested his title on a grant, (founded on   treasury warrant) to John Jones, dated August the 1st, 1787, for 3,000 acreg   1,500 acres of which were conveyed to the lessor by Jones, on. the 14th of April 1788  and proved pqssession in the defendant when the suit was commenced. The-defendant,-to support his title to the said 400 acres, offered in evidence a grant f r the same to Joseph Martin, dated January 1st, 1788, founded on a settlement-right, and intermediate conveyances to himself.1 He also offered in evidence, that a settlement was made on said land, in 1778, by William Fitzgerald, who assigned his-s ttlement-ri'ght to the said Joseph Martin  that a certificate in right' of settlement .was issued to Martin by the commissioners for adjust* ing tifj^s'to impatefited lands  on which certificate, and on the payment, of the composition money, the above grant was issued. This evidence was rejected by the court below. The defendant also offered in'efidenc  a deed of conveyance from the plaintiff s lessor to Arthur L. Campbell, dated January 2d, 1810, for the land in dispute  but the same was also rejected. He. also claim d the benefit of the statute of limitations of the state of Tennessee, on the ground that he, and those under whom he. claims, had be,en in continued and peaceable possession of the 40Q acres since the year 1788. The court decided that the statute did not apply. The cause was then brought before this court by. writ of error. Feb. 24th. Mr.  aw for the plaintiff in error, argued, 1. That the'defendant below ou^ht to ha vie been permitted to give evidence showing that his . grant had preference in eq ity over the plaintiff s grant. By the law, as settled in Tennessee, the. prior settlement right' of the defendant, though an equitable title, might be set up as a sufficient title jn an action at law. The opinion of the judge below proceeds on the idea that the Virginia practice must prevail, under which such a title could only be asserted in equity. The acts .-for carrying into effect the compact settling the boundary, declare that the claims and titles'derived from Virginia shall not be .affected or prejudiced by the change of jurisdictio h. But are the claims and titles less secure, if the forms of legal proceedings of Tennessee be adopted? Is there any difference whether the plaintiff ^ grant be vacated on the equity side of the court, or rendered inoperative in an actioin of ejectment? It is admitted, that as to the nature, validity, and construction or contracts, the lex loci must prevail. But the tribunals of one Country' hive never carried theif courtesy to other countries so far as to eh&oge the form of action, and  the course of judicial proceedings, or the time within which the . action must be commenced. 2. The deed from the plaintiff s lessor, pending the suit, showed an outstanding title in another, and ought to have prevented the plaintiff from recovering, 3i It is a universal principle that the statute of limitations of the place where the' suit is brought is to govern in determining the time within, which a suit must be commenced 4. New exceptions to the operation of the statute off limitations as to real property cannot be constructively established' by the courts. The statute of limitations of Tennessee ought to he applied to suits commenced in the courts of Tennessee for lands which were always, within the jurisdiction of that state as claimed by her, and which fell within her territory upon the final settlement of' the boundary. The title to such lands pay be determinable only by the law of. Virginia  but the mode of pursuing the remedy on that title must   depend upon the lex fori. The Attorney-General, contra, insisted, that by the compact between the two states, the law of Virginia, was made the law of the titles to these lands. By the settled practice of that state, as Well as the established doctrine of the common law, the legal title-must prevail ii. a court of law. The case of real property is an exception to the general rule, as -to applying the statute of limitations according to the lex fori, and not according to the iea: loci. Generally speaking, suits for such property jaust be commenced in the courts, of the'country where the land lies, and, cousequently, both the right and the remedy are to be determined by one and the same law. But this is an anomalous case depending- upon the peculiar na~' ture and provisions  f the compact of 1802, between the two states. The statute of limitations of Tennessee could not operate upon these lands until they were ascertained to lie in Tennessee  and the peculiar rule established by the courts of Tennessee,'permitting an equitable title to be asserted in an action at law, would not apply to a controversy concerning titles wholly depending on :he law of Virginia. The proceedings in ejectment are fictitious in form, but for all the purposes of substantial justice they are considered as real. If the term expire pending the action, the court will permit it to he enlarged, and no conveyance by the lessor of the plaintiffs while the suit is going on can operate to extinguish the prior lease. The court below, therefore, committed no error in refusing to perthedeed of conveyance from the plaintiff s lessor to be given in evidence in order-to establish the existence of an outstanding title-. ttmne u right, in S * cannot asserted as a sufficient title than action at ^ssee to Soverlands lying within the dis-g*aedterritory ginia and l/y'the Jgyto w fh in the limits of TpGnocsscc  the titles of Merited hfrorn finia3 by Vir  Feb. 24th.

      "judges:   parties:  Thatcher et al. v. Powell et al. Lessee. opinions:  This cause was argued at the last term, and at the present term the opinion of the Court was delivered by Mr. Chief Justice Marshall. This was an action of ejectment instituted by the defendants in error against the plaintiffs, to recover 640 acres of land in Montgomery county. Upon the trial in the Court below, the lessors of the plaintiffs, in support of their title, read in evidence a grant from the State of North Carolina to Stokeley Donaldson, dated the 12th of January, 1797  also a deed for the same land from the said Donaldson to John Love, dated the 13th of January, 1797, and registered in Montgomery county, on the 25th of July, 1815, upon- a probate made in the County Court of Grange county, at May term of the said Court, 1814. The defendants in that Court, to support their title, read in evidence a transcript of a record from the County Court of Montgomery county, at their July session of 1801, as follows, viz :   Haydon Wells, who was appointed by the Court of Jantfary term, 1801, to receive the list of taxable property in Gaptain Boyd s company, reports to Court a list of taxable property in the county of Montgomery, not listed for the year 1799, nor taxes paid thereon, to wit: among others,   Stokeley Donaldson 2,560 acres on Yellow Creek waters.    Haydon Wells, T. P.    Ordered, that the clerk make out a certificate of lands and tenements reported by Haydon Wells, Esq. for the year 1799, that are liable to the payment of taxes, agreeably to the 14th section of   an act to ascertain what property in this State shall be deemed taxable, and the mode of collecting, accounting for, and paying public taxes.  And now, to wit, at January term, 1802, the following proceedings were had thereon, to wit, on motion, it is ordered, adjudged, and decreed, that the tracts of land entered in the names of the following persons, be subject to the payment of taxes due thereon, agreeably to report of Haydon Wells, Esq. receiver of taxable property, as delinquent for the year 1799, agreeably to law, and that execution issue accordingly:  (among others,) Stokeley Donaldson, 11 dollars 90 cents. Upon which order or judgment, an execution, bearing date the fourth Monday in March, 1802, was issued to the sheriff of Montgomery county, commanding him, that of the lands of Stokeley Donaldson, reported to be in arrears for taxes for the year 1799, he cause to be made the sum -of 11 dollars 90 cents, as, also, the sum of 1 dollar 40 cents, and charges, &c. Upon this execution' the sheriff made the following return : t( Levied on 2133, and advertised agreeably to the old   not sold, because the new act which requires it to. be advertised in the Gazette did not come forward till the day of sale.   John Saunders, Sheriff M. C.  On the 1st of May, 1802, an alias execution issued, bearing date the fourth Monday in April, 1802, in the words of the former, on which the sheriff made the following return :   The within land sold agreeably to law, on the 23d of July, 1802  at seven mills per acre.  They also read in evidence a deed, from John Cocke, Sheriff of Montgomery county, to Samuel Vance, one of the defendants, dated the 14th of April, 1808, reciting,- that whereas John Saunders, late Sheriff of Montgomery county, did, on the 23d of July, 1802, by virtue of an execution or order of sale, to him directed, from the Court of Montgomery county, expose to sale 2,560 acres of land granted to Stokeley Donaldson, or so much thereof as would be sufficient to satisfy the taxes due thereon for the year 1799, agreeably to an act of Assembly in such cases made and provided. And whereas Morgan Brown became the purchaser of 2,229 6-7 acres of the said land at seven mills per acre, he being the highest and best bidder, the taxes and costs due thereon being. 17 dollars 10 cents  and the said Morgan Brown having authorized a deed to be made therefor to Samuel Vance: Now, the said- John Cocke, in consideration of the said sum being paid to the said John Saunders, Sheriff, Sic. doth sell and convey the said 2,229.6-7 acres of land, &c. The said deed, then described one tract of 640 acres, the tract in question  also, two other tracts of 640 acres each  also, one other part of a survey of land of 309 acres granted to Stokeley Donaldson. The lessors of the plaintiffs then introduced grants from the State of North Carolina to Stokeley Donaldson, all dated about the same time, for two different tracts of land of 640 acres each, a part of which are those described in the said Sheriff s deed, all lying upon the waters of Yellow Creek, and proved that the same lay in one connection of surveys adjoining each other, but those described in the Sheriff s deed were of much the greatest value. Upon this evidence the Court instructed the jury, that it was for them to determine whether the said lands in the said Sheriff s deed mentioned, were the same lands which the former Sheriff Saunders had sold'or not. If not the same land, then the. said Sheriff s deed was not good in law. And the Court farther instructed the jury, that the said record, or any thing therein contained, was not sufficient in law to authorize the sale of the lands made by the said Sheriff Saunders, nor the deed aforesaid made to the said Vance by the said John Cocke, the said successor of the said Saunders, and that the said sale and deed did not in law vest any title to said lands in the said Samuel Vance. To this instruction of the Court, the counsel for the defendants  xc pted. In consequence of this instruction, the jury found a verdict for the plaintiffs, and a judgment was accordingly rendered in their favour. The cause was then brought by writ of error to this Court. The objections made on the record to the title papers of the plaintiff, so far as respects their registration, have not been pressed in this Court, and do not appear tobe sustainable. The plaintiffs in error rely principally on the deed made by John Cocke, the sheriff of Montgomery county, on the 14th of April, 1808, and. insist that the instruction given by the Circuit Court to the jury, on this point, is erroneous. The validity of this deed depends on the act passed by. the Legislature of the State of Tennessee, on the 26th of October, 1797, respecting the collection of taxes. The 3d section of that act directs the Court of each county, at its session, in the mpnth of January, in each year, to appoint a justice of the peace, for each captain s district in. the county, to receive lists of the taxable property, for the then present year.  The 5th section makes it the duty of the sheriff to discover, and report in writing, to the clerk of the Court, such taxable property as may not haye been returned within the time limited by law. The 6th section directs non-residents to return to the Court an inventory of their taxable property. The 9th section enacts, that if any non-resident   shall fail, by himsfclf, his agent, or attorney, to return his, her, or their taxable property, as by the act directed, the property of such person, so failing, shall be liable, and stand bound to pay a fine of fifty dollars, and a double tax, to be collected and paid, as by this act directed, and the justice shall report the said property to the best of his knowledge and information as aforesaid.  The thirteenth section directs the sheriff, in the event of the non-payment of taxes by a specified time,   to levy the same by distress and sale of the. goods and chattels of every person so neglecting.  And the 14th section directs the sheriff, in case there shall not be any goods and chattels on which distress may be made, to report the same to the Court of the county, whose duty it is   forthwith to direct the clerk to make out a certificate of the lands and tenements liable for payment of the said taxes, together with the amount of taxes and charges due thereon.  This is to be published, and if no person shall pay the taxes and other charges, within thirty days, the   Court shall enter up judg-tneht for the amount of taxes due,  &c. for which execution shall issue, under which execution the land may be sold and conveyed by the sheriff. That no individual or public officer can sell, and convey a good title to, the land of another, unless authorized so to do by express law, is one of those self-evident propositions to which the mind assents, without hesitation  and that the person invested with such a power, must pursue with precision the course prescribed by law, or his act is invalid, is a principle which has been repeatedly recognised in this Court. The validity of the sale and deed made by the sheriff of Montgomery county will then depend on the regularity of the order under which the sale was made, and on the question whether tha|, order, if erroneous, will still support the sale which has been made in pursuance of it. Previous to an order for the sale of lands for the non-payment of taxes, the sheriff is ordered to levy them by distress and sale of the goods and chattels of the delinquent  and if there be no such goods and chattels, he is to report, the same to the Court, as the foundation of any proceeding against the lands. By this act, no jurisdiction is given to the Court over the lands of a person who has failed to pay his taxes, until the sheriff shall report that there are no goods and chattels out of which the taxes may be made. This being an important fact on which the juris - diction of the Court depends, it ought, we think, to appear on record, either in the judgment itself, or in the previous proceedings. In this case no such report appears to have been made. Could it even be contended that this report might be presumed, the answer is, that the terms of the order exclude such a presumption. It would appear, that the report of the magistrate, that the land in question had not been listed, was made in July, 1801, and that the Court immediately, made that order which the law directs to be made on the sheriff s'report, that there are no goods and chattels'  and this order , refers not to any report of the sheriff, no.t to any deficiency of goods and chattels,, but to the report of the justice of peace, that the lands have not been listed. This is not the only defect which appears in these-proceedings. Previous to an order for a sale of land, and subsequent - to the report of the sheriff, certain publications -are to be . made in the manner and form prescribed by the act.' These publications are indispensable preliminaries to the order of sale. They do not appear to have been made. The judgment against the  ttnd was given at January term, 1802, on motion, without its appearing by recital or otherwise, that the requisites of the law, in this respect, had been complied with, and. that the tax still remained unpaid. We think this ought to have appeared in the record. The argument is, that the judgment, for these errors in the proceedings of the County Court, may be voidable, but is not void  that until it be reversed, it is capable of supporting those subsequent proceedings which were founded on it. We think otherwise. . In summary proceedings,* where a Court exercises an extraordinary power under a special statute prescribing its course, we think that course ought to be exactly observed, and those facts, especially which give jurisdiction, ought to appear, in order to show that its proceedings are coram judice. Without this act of Assembly, the order for sale .would have been totally void. This act gives the power only on a report to be mad  by.the Sheriff.:  This report. gives the Court jurisdiction  and without it, the Court is as powerless as if the act had neyer passed. In construing the acts of the Legislature of a State, the decisiQns of the State tribunals have always governed this .Court. In Tennessee, the question arising in this cause, after considerable discussion, seems to have been finally settled on principles which are thought entirely correct.' The case of Francis  Lessee v. Washburn & Russell, reported in 5 Haywood, is this very case, and was decided as this case was decided in the Circuit. Court. On the authority of that case, and on principle, the Court is of opinion, that there is no error in the judgment of the Circuit Court. Judgment affirmed. attorneys:   corrections:  head_matter: (Local Law.) Thatcher et al. v. Powell et al. Lessee. February 12th. The'execution by a public officer of a poder o sell lands for the non.payment of taxes, must be in strict pursuance of the law under which it is made, or no title is conveyed. It ia essential to the validity of the sale of lands for taxes, under the . laws of Tennessee, that it should appear on the record of the Court, by which the order of sale  b made, that the Sheriff had returned that there were no goods and chattels of the delinquent proprietor out of which the taxes could be made. The publications which are required by law to be made, subsequent to the Sheriff s return, and previous to the order of sale, are indispensable preliminaries to a valid order of sale. In summaiy proceedings, where a Court exercises an extraordinary power under a special statute, which prescribes its course, that course ought to be strictly pursued, and the facts which give jurisdiction, ought to appear on the face of the record. Otherwise, the proceedings are not mer ly voidable, but absolutely void, as being comm non judice. In construing local statutes respecting real property, this Court is governed by the decisions of the State tribunals. Error to the Circuit Court of West Teanessee.\n",

      "judges:   parties:  John Beaty, Plaintiff in Error vs. The Lessee of A. Knowler and others, Defendant in Error. opinions:  Mr Justice M Lean delivered the opinion of the Court. This was an action of ejectment, brought in the circuit court of Ohio, to recover possession of one thousand two hundred acres of land, parcel of two thousand four hundred acres, in what is called the Connecticut reserve. On the trial below, it was agreed, that Jonathan Douglas, the ancestor of the plaintiff s lessors, became proprietor of the premises in question, in May 1792, under the laws of Connecticut, granting lands to certain sufferers, and died the 6th of March 1800, vested with the legal title  which he held in common with many other proprietors, the land not being set apart, or apportioned to any one of the whole. That the lessors of the plaintiff were his heirs at law, and held as partners or tenants in common. On .the trial it was proved by the plaintiff below, that on the 5th of May 1S08, four of the lessors were minors. The defendant set up a title under a tax sale, which was made by the company incorporated for the management of said lands. This company was first incorporated by the Connecticut legislature, in the year 1796. No person is named in the act  but the-corporators are designated, as the   proprietors of the half million of acres of land lying south of lake Erie.  Under this law the corporation was organized. In 1797, the Connecticut legislature passed an amendment to this law. On the 15th of April 1803, the legislature of Ohio passed an act incorporating those owners and proprietors, by the name of   the proprietors of the half million of acres of land lying south of lake Erie, called sufferers  land and by that name gave succession to them, their heirs and  ssigns. This was called the suffeiers  land,, from the circumstance of its having been given by the state of Connecticut to indemnify the losses its citizens had sustained in the revolutionary war. The act of incorporation by the legislature  of Ohio required nine directors to be appointed, who, were authorised to hold their meetings out of the state. In the second section, power is given to the directors to extinguish the Indian title  to survey the land into townships, or otherwise to make partition, as they should order, among the owners, in proportion to the amount of loss: and amongst other things, the act provided,   that to defray all necessary expenses of said company, in purchasing and in extinguishing the Indian claim of title to the land, surveying, locating, and making partition thereof, as aforesaid, and all other necessary expenses of said company, power be, and the same is hereby given to, and vested in the said directors and their successors in-office, to levy a tax or taxes (two-thirds of the directors present agreeing thereto,) on said land, and have, power to enforce the collection thereof.  The ninth section provides,   that all sales of rights, or parts of rights, of any owner or proprietor in said half million acres of land, made by the collector, shall be go d and valid, so as to secure an absolute title in the purchaser  unless the said owner and proprietor shall redeem the same within six calendar months next after the sale thereof, by paying the taxes for which the said right or rights, or parts thereof, had been sold, with twelve-per cent, interest thereon, and costs of suit.  The act contains not provision in favour of the rights of infants or femes covert. By the tenth section of this law it is provided,  that said directors shall have power and authority, and the same is hereby given to them and their successors, to do whatever shall to them appear necessary and proper to be done, for the well ordering and interest of said owners and proprietors, not contrary to the laws of the state.  The eleventh directs that  supplies of money which shall remain in the hands of the treasurer,, after the Indian title shall be extinguished, and said land located, -and partition thereof made, shall be-used by said directors for the laying out and improving the public road in said tract, as this assembly. shall direct.  The act is declared to b,e a public one in the, twelfth section. An act imposing' a land tax was passed by the Ohio legislature in 1806, which remained in force in 1808. This act required entry to be made of lands for taxation. A perpetual lien was imposed on the land, whether entered or not, for the amount of the tax, and minors had a right to redeem their land sold for taxes, within one year after their minority expired. It  ppeared in proof, at the trial, that at a meeting of the directors of the company convened at the court house in New Haven, on Thursday the 5th of May 1808, agreeably to.a notification duly issued. according to the ordinances of said directors  it'was unanimously voted by six directors, being all that were present, that a tax of two cents on the pound, original loss, b.e assessed on the original rights or losses, in said half million acres of land, to be paid by each proprietor thereof, in proportion to each person s respective share'or loss, as set in the grant of said lands made by the. state of Connecticut  to be collected and paid by the several collectors to the treasurer of this company, on or before the 1st of July 1808, to. defray the expenses of a tax laid by the legislature of the state of Ohio, and other necessary expenses, for the good of the proprietors of said land. The defendant gave in evidence the assessment of a tax upon the rights of the said Jonathan Douglas,'the appointment of a collector, the issuing of a warrant of collection, the advertisement of sale for taxes, the sale of a part of the right of said Douglas, amounting to twelve, hundred acres, for taxes, to Elias Perkins, who conveyed the tract to the defendant. The circuit court instructed the jury, that the directors had no power to assess said tax. And that the infant lessors were not concluded or bound by such assessment. To these instructions the defendant excepted. The jury found a verdict of guilty, and judgment was rendered thereon. A reversal of this judgment is prayed for by the plaintiff in error, on the following grounds : 1. The court erred in their instruction to the jury, that the directors had no legal authority to assess the tax : 2. That the minor proprietors were not bound and concluded by the assessment and sale. It is not contended in this case, that this company could derive corporate powers to do any act in Ohio, in- relation to the sufferers  land, under the statute of Connecticut. All their powers must be derived from the law of Ohio. This law, it is insisted, is a private act, not designed for public purposes, and consequently cannot affect the rights of any individual who did not assent to its provisions. That the provision declaring it to be a public act, does not alter the principle  for the rights derived under it are of a private nature, being limited to those who have an interest in the land  and it is denied,, that any evidence of assent has been shown by the lessors of the plaintiff or their ancestor. Several authorities were cited, as having a bearing upon the objections thus stated. The names of the sufferers are. published in the Connecticut act or resolution in 1,792, with .the amount allowed to each, as his indemnity for losses sustained. In this act is found the name of the ancestor of the lessors of the plaintiff. His right descended to them, subject to the same conditions by which it was originally held.: The provision of the law of incorporation-, tlfat it should be considered a publict act, must be regarded in courts of justice, and its enactments noticed, without being specially pleaded  as would be necessary, if the act were private.   That a private act of incorporation cannot affect the rights of individuals who do not assent to it, and that in this respect it is considered in the light of a contract, is a position too clear to admit of controversy. But, in the present case, this -objection seems not to have been made in the court below  where proof of the assent, if necessary, might have been submitted to the jury. From the nature of the right asserted, and the circumstances under which it was originated, this court cannot doubt that the assent of the proprietors may be'fairly presumed both to the act of Connecticut and to that of Ohio.' Rights have been protected and regulated under those laws, and to the provisions of the latter ar  the claimants indebted, in a great degree, for the present value of the remainder of the land, which they still hold   and, as has been well argued, if they participate in the benefits of the law, .they can set up no exemption from its penalties. The main question in the case is, whether the directors have the power, under the act of incorporation, to assess a tax on each proprietor s share, to pay a tax to the state. That a corporation is strictly limited to the exercise of those' powers, which are specifically conferred on it, will n t be denied. The exercise of the corporate franchise, being. restrictive-of individual rights, cannot be extended beyond ..the letter and spirit of the act of incorporation. In the second section of the act', power is given to the directors to extinguish the lndian title, under the authority of the United States, when obtained  to survey and locate the land into townships, or otherwise to make partition  and to defray all necessary expenses in carrying these objects into effect  and to meet these and   all other necessary expenses of said company,  the directors .are authorised to levy a tax or taxes on said land, and to enforce the collection thereof. As the power to tax for the purpose of paying a tax to the state, is not found among the enumerated powers of the directors, it must be derived, if it exist, under the words,   all other necessary expenses of said company    or under the tenth section, which provides, that   the directors shall have power to do whatever to them- shall appear necessary and proper to be done, for the well ordering and interest of the proprietors, not contrary to the laws of the state   In favour of this construction, it has been ingeniously argued, that partition not having been made of the land, it could not be entered for taxation as required by the law of the state. That the half million of acres must be entered on the duplicate of the collector as one tract, and -that it would be impracticable for the collector to ascertain gnd collect from each proprietor his just proportion of the tax. That many of the proprietors are non-residents, and that any proportion of them, being desirous of paying their part of the tax, would not be discharged by doing so  as a part of the entire tract, involving their Interests, would be' liable to be sold for any balance of the tax which remained unpaid.  Whether partition was made of the land, when the directors assessed the tax, does not appear, nor is it considered a fact of much importance in the case. No argument drawn from convenience, can enlarge the powers of the corporation. Was the tax imposed a  necessary- expense of said' company,  within the meaning of the act 1 Th t these words would cover the expense of necessary agents to assess and collect a tax legitimately imposed by. the directors, is clear, and also other incidental expenses, arising from carrying into effect the powers expressly given  but do they invest the directors with a new and substantive power ? If they do, how is the exercise of the power to be limited ? Must it depend upon the discretion of the directors, to determine all necessary expenses of the company. Ample' provisions are found in the state law imposing a land tax, for the assessment and collection of the tax.. A lien is held on all the,taxable land in the state, whether entered for taxation or hot  and if the tax should not be paid by a time specified, the collector was authorised, after giving notice, to sell the smallest part of the tract, which would bring the amount of the tax. For the convenience of-non-residents, district collectors were appointed, who were required to hold their offices at places named in the act. The collector for the district including the sufferers  land, held his office at Warren, within what is called the reservation of Connecticut. The law imposing th  tax operates upon the land in controversy, and raises a lien   the same as on any othe*- taxable lands in the state. It appears, therefore, that it was not the intention- of the1 legislature to look to the corporation for the payment of the tax assessed under the law, but to the land, as in all other cases. And if any part of the land had been sold, by the state, in which, minora had an interest, under the law, they had aright to redeem it within a year after they be-, came of age. This is an important provision, and is not contained in the act. of incorporation.. The agents of the state were paid for their services out of the tax collected  those of the corporation by the company. It would seem, therefore, that the tax collected by the state would be less expensive to the proprietors, than if collected by their'own agents  and less hazardous to their rights, as the interests of minors were protected. If, therefore, the argument drawn from convenience could have any influence, it could not operate favourably to the power of the directors. The power to impose a tax on real estate, and to sell it where there is a failure to pay the tax, is   high prerogative, and should never be exercised where the right is doubtful. In the preamble to the Ohio act of incorporation, there is a reference to the Connecticut act, and to the cession of the reserve, by that state, to the union  and a statement that it was-annexed to the state of Ohio.,. And as a reason for the passage of the act, it is stated, that said   hajf million of acres of land are now within the limits of Tru'mble county in said state, and are still subject to Indian claims of title   wherefore, to enable Hie owners and proprietors of said half million acres of land, to purchase and extinguish the Indian claim of title to the same, (under the authority of the United States, when the same shall be obtained,) to survey and locate the said land, and to make partition thereof to and among said owners and proprietors, in proportion to the amount'of losses, which is or shall be by them respectively owned,  &c. These are the Objects to be accomplished by the act of incorporation, and which could not be attained by the individual efforts of the proprietors. In the- eleventh section of the act it is provided,   that supplies of money which shall remain in the hands of the treasurer, after th$ Indian title shall be extinguished, and said land located and partition thereof made, shall be used by said directors for the laying out and improving the public roads in said tract, as the legislature should direct.  . From a careful inspection of the whole act, it clearly appears that the incorporation of the company was designed to enable the proprietors to accomplish specific objects, and that no more power was given than was considered necessary to attain these objects. The words   all necessary expenses of the company  cannot be so construed as to enlarge the power to tax, which is given for specific purposes. A tax to the state is not a necessary expense of the company, within the meaning of the act. -Such an expense can only result from the action of the company in the exercise of its corporate powers. The provision in the tenth section, that the   directors shall have power to do whatever shall appear to them to be necessary and proper to be done, for the well ordering of the interest of the proprietors, not contrary to the laws of the statewas not intended to give unlimited power, but the exercise of a discretion, within the scope of the authority conferred. If the words of this section are not to be restricted by, the other provisions of the statute, but to be considered according to their literal import, they wPuld vest in the directors a power over the land, only limited by their discretion. They could dispose of the land and vest the proceeds in any manner which they might suppose would advance the interest of the proprietors.' It is only necessary to. state this consequence, to show the danger of such a construction. The restrictions imposed, in other, parts of the statute, very clearly demonstrate, that it was riot the intention of the legislature to invest the directors with such a power. Upon a full view of the various provisions of the act of incorporation, the court do not find a power given to the directors to assess a tax, as has been done, in the case under consideration, to pay a tax to the state. The judgment of the circuit court must, therefore, be affirmed with costs. attorneys:  The case was argued by Mr J. C. Wright,, for the plaintiff  and by Mr Vinton for the d fenaant     Mr Wright contended, that the court below erred in their instruction to the jury.    Mr Vinton, for the defendant in error, contended,    Mr Wright, in reply, corrections:  head_matter: John Beaty, Plaintiff in Error vs. The Lessee of A. Knowler and others, Defendant in Error. Ejectment. The defendant claimed the land in controversy under a tax sale, which was made by a company incorporated by the legislature of Connecticut, in 1796, called   The proprietors of tire half million of acres of land lying south of lake Erie,  and incorporated by an act of the legislature of Ohio,' passed on the 15th of April 1803, by the name of   The proprietors of the half million of acres of land lying south of lake Erie, called the sufferers  land.  In 1806 the legislature of Ohio imposed a land tax, and authorised the sale of the lands in the state for unpaid taxes, giving to the owners the right to redeem within one year after the determination of their minority. This act was in force in 1808. In 18.08 the directors of the company, incorporated by the legislatures of Connecticut and Ohio, assessed two cents per acre on the lands of the company, for the payment of the tax laid by the state of Ohio, and authorised the sale of those lands on which the assessments were not paid. The lands purchased by the defendant were the property of minors at the time of the sale, they having been sold to pay the said assessnaents under the authority of the directors of the company. Held, that the sale of the land under which the defendant claimed was void. The provisions in the act of incorporation'of Ohio, that it should be Considered a public act, must be regarded in courts   and its enactments noticed without being specially pleaded, as would be necessary if the act were private. [167] That a corporation is strictly limited to the exercise of those powers which are specifically conferred on it, will not be denied. The exercise of the corporate franchise, being restrictive of individual rights, cannot be extended beyond the letter and spirit of th  act of incorporation. [168] From a careful inspection of the whole act, it clearly appears that the incorporation of the company was designed to enable the proprietors to accomplish specific objects, and that no more power was given than was considered necessary to attain those objects. [171] The words,   all-necessary expenses, of the company,  cannot be so construea to enlarge the po'wer to tax, which is given for specific purposes. A tax by the state is not a necessary expense of the company, within the meaning of the act. Such an expense can only result from the action of the company in the exercise of its corporate powers. [171] The provision in the tenth section,   that the directors shall have power to do whatever shall appear to them to be necessary and proper to be. done for the well ordering of the interests of the proprietors, not contrary to the laws of the state,  was not intended to give unlimited power, but the exercise of a discretion within the scope, of the authority conferred. [171] FROM the circuit court of: Ohio. This was an ejectment for lands in the state of Ohio  and on the triaf in the circuit court the defendant excepted to the charge of the court, and prosecuted this writ of error. The facts are fully stated in the opinion of the court. The case was argued by Mr J. C. Wright,, for the plaintiff  and by Mr Vinton for the d fenaant  Mr Wright contended, that the court below erred in their instruction to the jury. 1. In instructing the jury, that the directors of the company incorporated by the legislature of Connecticut in the year 1796, designated as the   the Proprietors of the half millions of acres of lands lying on the south of-lake Erie,  and by a law of Ohio passed the 15th of April 1830, had no legal authority'to assess the tax on theiand, for the non-payment of which it was sold. 2. That the proprietors of the land included in the provisions of the acts, who were minors, were not bound by the assessment of the tax, and the sale of the land. He said the only questions which arose on1 the case are these  nothing else was excepted to on the trial. Those instructions involve the construction of certain laws of Connecticut, and of the state.of Ohio  which, in general, have received no interpretation from the courts in those states. The correctness of the instructions will depend on the law of Ohio  that of Connecticut having been introduced to show the history of the transaction out of which this controversy has arisen. But as the company was organized under the law of Ohio, and in a manner entirely different from that of the law of Connecticut, and the tax was laid according td its provisions, that is to be put out of the question. It was objected to the validity of the assessment of the taXr that the charter .does not authorise the directors to assess a tax to pay that levied by the legislature of Ohio. It is conceded at once, that the power is not given in express terms, but is fully includedrin the several powers to assess a tax. Act, of the 15th of April 1803, sec. 2. The pla.in and obvious reading of 'this grant of power is,  -.to  defray all necessary expenses of the said company .in purchasing and extinguishing the Indian claims of title, surveying, locating, making partition of the land  and to defray all other necessary expenses of said. company, power is given,  &c. Two descriptions of powers ar  confided to the directors by this provision. The first relates-to expenses necessary for specifi d objects  and the second is equally plenary tq all purposes    to defray the necessary-expenses of the saidJ company.  This power is also included in the tenth section of the act,  to do whatever shall to them appear necessary and,proper for the w ll ordering and interest of the company, not contrary to the laws of the state. If the directors, in the exercise of their discretion, thought the money to be raised by this assessment was pro'per to defray necessary expenses, or useful for the well ordering of the company, they had full power to lay the tax. It would be difficult to employ words to convey a more unlimited discretion to the directors  and their view in, laying the tax is, clearly developed in.the vote.   Voted unanimously that a tax of two cents on the pound be assessed to defray the expenses Of a tax laid by the legislature of Ohio, &c. and all other necessary expenses for the good of the proprietors of the said land.  If the directors had power to assess the tax, then, 2. Were the infant lessors bound by the assessment1? It will hardly be contended that minors  cannot in any event be clothed with powers as corporators 'that is indisputable. The resolve of the state of Connecticut released and quit claimed to eighteen hundred individuals named .in the act, the half million of acres,   and to their legal representatives where dead, and to their heirs and assigns for ever.  Swan s Ohio Land Laws, 81 to 100. The ahcest r of the lessors of the plaintiff was then alive, and one of the persons named in the. resolve. He took an estate in fee as a tenant in common with all the others. In 1792 Connecticut constituted these grantees a corporation, and gave them, their heirs and assigns, succession as corporators  and pro-: vided that the expenses and taxes should only be a charge on the* land. The ancestor of the plaintiff s lessors, with the other grantees, organized the corporation under this act, and partook of all the powers it conferred. By his death in 1800 the interest he held in the land devolved upon his heirs, sudject to the corporation  and by the very terms of the ch rter they took his place as corporators, representing together in the corporation the interest their parent had represented alone. These heirs were owners and proprietors of their ancestor s share in the lands, when Ohio incorporated them with all   the owners and proprietors.  This suit was brought in  825. when all the heirs were probably of age, as the tax was laid in .1808. Under the law, the lands were divided, and two thousand four hundred acres were, set. apart for the interest of Douglass, the ancestor of the lessors of the plaintiff. This division, the lessors recognize and ratify. They bring suit for a part of the allotment assigned to them in the division   and not for an undivided sixth of the two thousand four hundred acres, part of the five hundred thousand acres. They avail themselves of the act of incorporation, and yet claim they are not^corpor tors, nor bound by the acts of the directors under'it. The adult, as well as the minor heirs, have all gone on as corporators. No dissent was ever expressed   but, on the contrary, all, as one, represent the share. If these minors are not bound by the acts of the corporation, all remains as at the death of their ant esto : in 1808   and the partition must be gone into, anew  and the separate allotment, under which the forest has disappeared, and the wilderness has been made to blossom as the rose, is all to be done aWay, and the lands thrown into common. Every thing in the country will thus be thrown into confusion. . Would this be just to the co-tenants ? and yet it is the inevitable result of the principles given'in the instructions to the jury. Mr Vinton, for the defendant in error, contended, 1. That the lessors of the defendant in error were not parties to, .or bound by said acts of incorporation. 2. That the directors under the Ohio act of incorporation had no power to assess a tax to pay a state tax of that state. 3. That the tax was void for uncertainty, it being assessed in part for undefined purposes. 4: Th t the sale being conducted contrary to the manner prescribed by the laws of Ohio, was void. 5.. The sale was void, because the collector omitted to give the notice required by said act of incorporation of the time when the tax vyould become due. It'has been holden by this court, that a grant to-a private corporation is a contract  and consequently, to bind the corporators, their assent, express or implied, must be had. Dartmouth College vs. Woodward, 4 Wheat. 659, 657, 682. Ellis vs. Marshall, 2 Mass. 275, 279. It therefore becomes necessary to inquire if this is a private corporation   and if so,, whether the defendants in error-had,. by their assent, express or implied, made themselves parties to it. In 4 Wheat. 668, 669, public corporations are defined   to be such only as are founded by- the government for public purposes, where. the whole interests, belong also to the government.  This definition will.test the character of the corporation in question. The entire interest of this corporation consisted of private property, and the purpose of the act was the regulation of that property for the benefit-of the proprietors. The government of Ohio1 had no interest in the corporation  nor did it. seek to attain, any purpose of its own by the a.ct of incorporation. The declared objects of the act were, to enable the proprietors of the sufferers  lands,   to extinguish the Indian title  to survey them into townships or otherwise, and make partition of them among themselves. . These are all private purposes, intended for their own emolument and advantage. The corporation is therefore, in its -nature, a priyat  corporation. Here an inquiry arises as to the effect of tp  last section of the act of incorporation, which declares that act to be a public act. . A similar enactment has been introduced into the bank charters of that state, which no one ever imagined to be public corporations on that account. The evident intention of this declaration is not to chang  the nature of the corporation  but to relieve the corporators from the inconvenience of special pleading, and making proof of their corporate existence, according to the usages of the common law. To this extent the provision is politic and reasonable  but to go b.eyond that, and give it the effect of making the corporation a public corporation, in the sense of the, definition laid down, would be unreasonable, and according to the principles settled by this court in the Dartmouth College case, not in the power of the legislature of Ohio. 4 Wheat. 671, 672. This brings us to the question of assent. No.express assent by the defendants in error to this act of incorporation is pretended.- An implied assent is relied upon. Jonathan Douglass, the ancestor of the defendants in error, died in 1800. The act of incorporation, by the legislature of Ohio, was passed in 1803. And in 1808 the land in controversy was.sqld to pay a tax assessed under that act: At the time of the sale, four of the defendants in error were minors  and consequently not able in law to contractor, assent fo become corporators. Asaeht,.in such , a case, is not one of the exceptions to the legal .disabilities of infants. Lapse of time is relied upon to raise a presumption of assent  the common law fixes.the period at which the. presumption arises, at the ehd of twenty years  which had not elapsed when this suit was instituted. The counsel for the plaintiff in error has - argued, that.the present.cla'mants took the estate of their ancestor as he left it  and. has, on this - ground, endeavoured to make out the power of the legislature of Ohio to bind them by its act  because the legislature df Connecticut had, in 1796, incorporated the proprietors of these lands to enable them to effect simitar objects.   There is no proof that Jonathan Douglass ever gave his assent to the Connecticut act, and if he did, it has no connexion with the present case. The affairs of the Connecti,cut corporation were, conducted by a board differently organized, and called by a different name from the board of directors which assessed the tax under which the land in controversy was sold. The proceedings now called, in question were had under the act of Ohio. Douglass died in 1800, and it could not be one of the conditions on htcft ,his heirs inherited his estate that they should become parties to an act of incorporation that the state of Ohio, which then had no. being as a state, might pass three years after his death. Nor .does it follow, that because the ancestor or his heirs were parties.to one corporation, that therefore they were bound to become parties to a new and distinct corporation,  created by another and independent authority. It has been' urged upon the court that if this doctrine prevail, it will overturn a great amount of property  but that no more proves the fact of assent, than if it would only overturn a small amount. It has been further contended, that the suit now pending is predicated from the partition made by the directors under the Ohio act of incorporation, and consequently affirms their proceedings, and estops the defendants. in error from denying the fact of their assent. No principle of law is better settled, than- that one tenant in common may bring an ejectment against his companion to be let into possession. Every such tenant has a right to the common enjoyment of the whole and every part of the premises  and against all strangers,. he has an exclusive right of- pos-, session to the whole and every part thereof. From this principle, it follows, as a necessary consequence, that he has a right to his possessory action against such stranger for the whole or any part of the premises. The suit then, against the plaintiff in error as a trespasser upon a specific part of this grant of the land, is no admission by the defendants of a partition  and consequently is no affirmance of the partition, if any was made by the directors  which the record does not show. 2. The second point denies the authority, of the directors to assess the tax in question. In the case of Head vs. Providence Insurance Company, 2 Cranch. 167, 1 Condens. Rep. 371, the court say, that  a corporation may correctly.be said to be precisely whaf the incorporating act has made it, to derive all its powers from that act, and to be capable of exerting its faculties only in the manner that act authorises    and in 4 Wheat. 636, this court define a corporation in these words,   it is the mere creature of the law  and possesses only those properties, which the charter Of its creation confers upon it, either expressly or as incidental to its very existence.  Its powers are therefore to be construed strictly. To determine the question of the power of the directors to assess the tax, it is necessary to look into the incorporating act, and to examine it in all its parts. It is not pretended that the. act confers an express grant of power to assess the tax. The inquiry then arises, was the power incidental to the existence of the corporation *? A formal and specific enumeration of the purposes for which the corporation was created is set out in the preamble, and also in the second section of the act. . They are,   to extinguish the Indian .title to the grant of a half million acres of land, to survey and locate the same into townships or otherwise, and to make partition among the proprietors.  To effect these objects, and to defray all other necessary expenses of said company, power was given to the directors to levy taxes. Was the tax assessed by the state of Ohio, a company charge or expense*? The tax of the state was a lien upon the estate of each tenant in common, which his companion was no more bound to pay, than he would be to discharge the lien of a judgment at law, or a mortgage of his co-tenant. The twenty-third section of the -act of Ohio assessing the state tax, is conclusive of this point. It enacts, that when any tract of land charged with tax, is owned by two or more persons, the collector shall receive from any person tendering the same, his or her proportion of the tax due thereon. Under this provision of the act, any one of the proprietors might, by paying his^ proportion of the tax, discharge the-lien of the state upon his estate. And his interest could no more be affected by the sale of the right of-his companion for non-payment, than if that right were conveyed away by the companion himself, or sold to pay a judgment at law.' The tax of the state then was not a company charge  nor was the payment of it by the company in any way necessary- or incidental to the existence of the corporation. Again, was the aid of the corporation necessa'ry to-enable, the state to collect its tax *? The power of the state to collect its own taxes by its own agents, cannot be denied. If, therefore, we find the state did create its own agents for the collection of this tax, and put into their hands all the necessary means to discharge this duty,   every presumption ini favour of collecting it by the agents of the corporation is excluded. On looking into the tax law of Ohio, we find the tax covered all the lands in the state, the company s lands included  that agents were appointed to collect all thp tax without any exception  for this purpose, the state was divided .into collection districts, one of which embraced the land in controversy. The aid of the company, therefore, was not necessary to a perfect execution of the law of Ohio  and the means provided by the legislature for its execution excludes the idea, that it relied upon this corporation for any such assistance as it thought proper to volunteer. But it has been insisted, that tht tenth section of the. act of incorporation confers upon the directors the power to assess a tax to pay a tax of the state. It empowers them, in general terms, to do whatever to them shall appear necessary and proper to be done for the well ordering and interest of the proprietors, not contrary, to the laws of Ohio. This section contains no specific and substantive grant of power. It ought, therefore, to be construed to be a general grant of the means necessary arid proper for the execution of the specified purposes of the act of incorporation. So understood it does not in fact enlarge the powers of thfe corporation, and seems to have been introduced into the act from abundant caution. 3. Before the examination of the remaining points, it may be'proper to notice an objection that has been urged by the opposing counsel. It is insisted that we are not at iiberty to present either of these points to the court  because they do not form part of the opinion of the court below, to which exceptions were taken at the trial. The objection is predicated from the supposition, that the writ of error was sued out-to reverse the opinion of the court, instead of the judgment itself. The writ covers the whole record  and if it shall'appear from an inspection of it, that there is  o error in the judgment, it cannot be reversed, whatever may be the errors in the opinion of the court. The record sets out the proof of the title of the plaintiffs below. It is a perfect title. The title of the defendant below, as proved by him, is also spread upon the record. If that title is defective, it cannot avail him against the perfect title of his opponents. We are therefore at liberty to examine that title as it appears on the record. The third objection then is, that the tax was void, being assessed in part for undefined purposes. The objects of the tax are declared in the resolution of assessment to be   to defray the. expenses of a tax laid by the state of Ohio, and other necessary expenses for the good of the proprietors of the said land.  The taxing power of the corporation is limited to certain purposes specified in the incorporating- act, which would doubtless include the means necessary and proper for the full attainment of those purposes. It must be exercised within those limits  and in such a manner, that it can be known with certainty whether .they have been .exceeded. If otherwise, its assumptions of power could neither be detected nor controlled. For example, let it be conceded that the corporation had no power to assess a tax to pay a tax of- the state   is it not apparent that a tax for that purpose might be assessed under the vague terms   for the good of the proprietors !  The undefined portion of the tax must therefore be void. The tax is one entire and indivisible thing   and if void for part, it must be for the whole. It cannot be ascertained how much of the land in controversy, if any part of the tax was authorised, was sold to pay the valid, and how much the invalid portion of the tax. 4. The sale was contrary to the laws of- Ohio. By the tenth section of the act of incorporation the directors were restrained from doing those things that were contrary to the laws of the state. The collectors of the state tax were required to reside in their collection districts,- to give bond and security to the state for-the faithful collection and paying over the tax to the slate treasurer. The sale and collection in this case was made by a company collector, residing in a distant state   who gave no bond to the st te,nor was in any manner accountable.to it. The sale was made without the reservation of the right of redemption, which the law of Ohio secured to infants, and to others labouring under legal disabilities. The collector for the corporation exacted fees and charges not allowed by the laws of Ohio   and thus increased the amount of the tax beyond what the state collector was authorised to receive. In all these particulars, and others that might be enumerated, the sale was contrary to the settled law and .policy of Ohio, and therefore vicious. 5. Admitting the corporation had the power to assess and collect the tax in question  still in making the collection the company?s collector did not conform to all the requisites prescribed to him by the act of incorporation. That act requires the collector to give notice of the time when the tax became due, by advertising the same for at least three weeks. in a newspaper published in each of the. counties of New Haven, Fairfield, and New London, in the state of Connecticut. If the tax was not then paid, the collector was required to make another and further publication of the time and place of sale, for default of payment. The record shows an advertisement of sale, for non-payment   but does not show that proof was made of an advertisement of the time when the tax became due. The cases of Williams vs. Peyton, 4 Wheat. 79, 83, and of Parker vs. Rule s Lessee, 9 Cranch, 64, are expressly in point  and they show conclusively, that the advertisement cannot be presumed in the absence of proof  and that its omission is a fatal irregularity. Mr Wright, in reply, contended  that the provisions of the law of Ohio under which the tax was assessed, laid the tax on the whole body of the lands owned by the eighteen hundred persons. It was a common charge on the whole lands, which at the time were held- by the proprietors undivided. It was consequently a necessary expense upon the company for which the directors were authorised to provide, by the assessment of a tax. Th  law of Ohio looked to the land for the tax, and required the collectors to sell for the collection of it  and for the tax due on an entire undivided tract, an entire portion of the whole was directed to be sold. An attempt to sell in parcels, would be to make a partition among the proprietors. No one could pay his own tax and preserve his own share, because fee owned no specific part: his joint interest would be more or less prejudiced, if any sale for taxes of the entire tract took place. He proceeded to show, by a reference to the law of Ohio laying the tax, further difficulties which would have attended the sale of part of the whole body of the land for the tax  and he argued that the payment of the tax by the directors was necessary to preserve the lands of the company. It is said, the tenth section of the act of incorporatiqn confers no power to tax. That section was intended to give some power, and it authorises that tobe done which is  necessary and proper for the welL ordering and interests of the owners and proprietors.  These terms fully comprehend the power, and authorised t,he doing of that which Would save the property from sale under the state law. It is objected that the assessment is void for uncertainty, being in part for undefined purposes. It was for the Ohio tax, and other necessary expenses for the good of the proprietors of the land. . While it is admitted that it ought to have mentioned the objects, it is denied that it was required that they should be specified. Were they for the general interests, and for the general good 1 This has not been denied. In the act of incorporation there is no reservation in favour of minors. In the general law, minors are allowed to redeem in a yeat after attaining adult years. In what manner %' Not by treating the sale as void, but by paying the tax, interest and penalties, and for the improvements. These requisites  suppose the sale valid. But the question before the court, is one of power, not of policy. The omission of the legislature to make a politic provision concerning the rights of minors, does not deny the right  on the contrary, it admits the power. It cannot be maintained that this affects the validity of the sale. All the incapacities, and all the privileges of minors are the mere creatures of municipal law. The state of minority itself is created and regulated by that lavv, and the period of its duration varies in different states. The act of incorporation of Ohio operated upon adults and on minors alike. No distinction is made in respeGt to their rights. The courts cannot originate such distinctions. No authorities have b en adduced in . support of our positions. They are supposed to rest on principles familiar to the profession. Their application to the case before the court cannot be tested by precedent, for the whole case is one sui generis. The analogies illustrative of their application, result more directly from the principles themselves than from adjudged cases'  which can bear but remotely upon an insulated controversy.

      "judges:   parties:  Den ex dem. Walker v. Turner. opinions:  Mr. Justice Washington delivered the opinion of the Court. This was an ejectment brought in. May, 1818, in the Circuit Court fyr the District, of Tennessee, by the plaintiff-in error, to recover possession of a lot of ground in the town of Nashville, distinguished in the plan of the town,., as lot No. 85. Upon the trial of the cause, the plaintiff gave in evidence, a deed for flit* lot. in controversy, from the commissioners of the toivn of Nashville to the lessor of the plaintiff bearing date the 6th off August, 1790, and then proved the defendant to be in possession of the same at the time the suit was brought. The defendant then gave in evidence a record of the  County.Court , of Davidson, in the State of Tennessee, by which it appears, that upon the complaint of Roger B. Sappington, administrator of- Mark B. Sappington, deceased, to a Justice of the Peace for the said county  supported by,his oath,   that George Walker (the lessor of the plaintiff) was justly indebted to him, as administrator aforesaid, as appears by the books-of the said Mark, to the amount of 20 dollars arid 25 cents, and that the said Walker was an inhabitant of another government, so that the ordinary process of law could hot be served upon him, an attachment, bearing date the 24th of April, 5804, was awarded by the magistrate against the estate of the said Walker, which the officer was, by the said process, directed to, secure, so as.to be liable to further proceedings to, be had before the said Justice, or some other Justice for the said county. The return upon the attachment was, that no personal property was to be found   and on the 26th of April, 1804, judgment was rendered by the magistrate in favour of the plaintiff for 20 dollars and 25 cents, and costs, These proceedings, being carried into the Coun.ty Court of Davidson, the cause was there docketted,. and the defendant having appeared by attorney, a stay of six months, under the law, was. entered on the docket, At. the sessions of the Court, in October, 1804, the defendant entered special bail, and reprieved the property attached. The record then exhibits the following entry, viz.   On which attachment the said administrator nb- . tained judgment before J. A. Parker, [who issued the attachment,] a Justice of. the Peace, on the 26th of April, 1804  which proceedings being brought up. to Dayidson County Court, April sessions, 1804, and a stay of further  proceedings ordered to the present sessions, (October, 1804,), at which sessions bail was entered, in order to replevy the property attached  after which, and during the same sessions, the said Sappington moved the Court for an order to sell the property attached, whereupon the Court directed the .Clerk to issue orders of sale to the Sheriff, to sell the property attached.  The record proceeds to state, that, in pursuance of this judgment, orders of sale issued, returnable to the January sessions of 1805, but which did not appear to have been returned. The defendant then gave in evidence   deed, dated the 22d of July, 1809, from the Sheriff of Davidson county to Roger B. Sappington, for the lot in question, purchased by him at public auction, under process of the Court of said county,. for non-payment of the taxes due upon the said lot. The defendant also gave in evidence, a deed from the, said Roger B. Sappington to Lemuel P. Turner, deceased, to whom the defendant was prdved to be heir and devisee. He further proved, that shortly after the deed by the Sheriff' to. Roger B. Sappington, he (the grantee) exercised acts of ownership on the lot in question, by cutting trees, quarrying stones, &c. which he continued to do until |he sold the lot to Turner, but that he never resided on the lot, or had any continued possession thereof, except as above stated. The next evidence given by the defendant, was a deed, dated the day of January, 1806, from the Sheriff of Davidson county to Roger B. Sap-pington,. which, after reciting all the proceedings before mentioned, before the magistrate of Davidson county, and the Court of that county, in the suit of Sappington against Walker, the, writ of vend. expo, to sell the said lot, issued by the said County Court, and the purchase of the same by the said Sappington, as the highest bidder  at public auction  conveys the said lot to him. The defendant then proved, that in the year 1811 or 1812, Lemuel P. Turner commenced building a stone fence on this lot, which he was one or two years engaged in completing  that he commenced building a. house on the lot,, which he incessantly persevered in till it was finished, after which he removed into it, in 1812 or 1813. Upon the above evidence, set forth in a bill of exceptions to the opinion of the Court, the charge to the jury was, that the deed from the Sheriff of Davidson county to R. B. Sappington, under the judgment of Sappington s. administrator, against Walker,, was sufficient, if the jury.believed the facts to be as above, stated,, to vest the title of said Walker . .to .said lot in Sappington the purchaser at the execution sale  that the tribunal that adjudicated, and from whom to  execution issued, had jurisdiction .of the subject- matter, and that the parties,' too, were in Court.  that the deeds aforesaid were of such a colour or appearance of title as, connected with seyen years peaceable and continued possession, by the persons claiming under them  and the .grant to Walker, would protect the possession under-the statute of limitations. The f ct as to possession was left to the jury  The Judge further stated, that a. pspty, to he.protected by the statute,.-must have an adverse continued possession of the land in dispute, either by actually residing on it, or by having it enclosed with a stone fence, and that a possession, by such enclosing or fence, would be sufficient, without an aetual residence on the land. This charge, presents, for the. consideration of the Court, the following questions: 1. Whether the deed, from the Sheriff of Davidson county to Sappington, did vest in the latter a title, to the land in question ? 2. Whether, under the circumstances stated in the bill of exceptions, the possession of the.defendant was protected by the statute ef limitations of the State of Tennessee ? 3. Whether the Court below was right in the statement made to the jury, as to what, constitutes a possession to be protected by the act of limitations. 1. Whether the Sheriff s deed conveyed to' Sappingtoft a title to the land in controversy, depends upon the Question, whether the sale was madq under the judgment of a tribunal having jurisdiction of the cause in which it was rendered. The judgment was rendered by a Justice of the Peace, upon an attachment issued by him against   non-resident, and returnable before himself  and the order for selling th  property attached, was made by the County Court, ,It does not, however, appear by the return made upon the attachment, that the lot in dispute, or any other property of Walker, was attached   nor does it even appear, otherwise  than by a recital in the deed from the Sheriff to Sappington, that any process issued from the County Court, which' authorized the Sheriff to sell this lot. Evidence , was given by the Clerk, that an execution issued, corresponding with the order of the Court, but that the exer cution could not be found. If the execution corresponded with the order of the Court, then it authorized the sale of the property attached   and as the return of the constable does not state that any property was attached, it is difficult to perceive by what authority the lot in dispute was sold to Sappington. As to the recital in the deed from the Sheriff to Sappington, that the wrjt of vend  tioni exponas, under which, the sale was made, authorized the sale of this lot, it is inadmissible as evidence of that fact against the plaintiff, who was neither a party noi  privy to the deed. But passing by this objection to the validity of the sale, the Court will inquire, whether the same was sanctioned by the judgment of a tribunal having competent jurisdiction of the case in which it was rendered. It is, in the first place, by no means tobe admitted, that at the time these proceedings were instituted, a Justice of the Peace was authorized, by the laws of Tennessee, to issue an attachment against the estate of a non-resident debt- or, returnable before himself, and determinable by him. By the 19th, 20th, and 21st sections of. the act of 1794, a Justice of the Peace is empowered to issue an attachment, against the estate of a debtor who has removed, or is removing himself privately out of. the county, or who so absconds and conceals himself, that the ordinary process of law cannot be served upon him   and  lso, against the estate of a non-resident  but in all these cases, the attachment is to be returned to the Court where the suit is cognizable, and is to be there adjudicated. This attachment may be levied on the lands, goods, and chattels of the debtor. By the 56th section of this act, the magistrate is authorized, in cases where by the said act he has jurisdiction, to ,issue an attachment, against the estate of an absconding or absent debt- or   and the proceedings thereon, before him, are to be in a summary way, as on a warrant. The Court does not understand that this section extends to persons who are citizens and residents without the limits of Tennessee. It may well be doubted, then, whether the proceedings before the Justice were not, on this ground, coram non judice. But without giving a positive decision upon that point, the Court is of opinion, that the Justice had not jurisdiction of the subject matter, upon which his judgment was rendered. By the 52d section of the above act, jurisdiction is given to any Justice of the Peace, in cases of d bts and demands amounting to twenty dollars and under, where the balance is due on any specialty, note, or agreement, for money or specific articles,, or for goods, wares and merchandise, sold and delivered, or work and labour done  in which cases he is empowered to'render judgment, and to award execution against the goods and chattels, or the body of the debtor. It is admitted by the counsel, that a subsequent law raised the jurisdiction of the Justice beyond the sum for which this judgment was rendered. By the act of 1786, which we understand is still, in force in Tennessee, it is provided, that when an execution is in the hands of a constable, in consequence of a judgment of a Justice of the Peace, and there, shall be no personal property whereon to levy it, in such case he shall levy it on the real estate of the defendant, and make return thereof to the next County Court, that the Court may order the Sheriff to sell the said real estate, or enougli ther'eof, according to law. Whether it was under this act, that the proceedings before the magistrate found their way into the County . Court, it is impossible for this Court to decide.. It doris not se m to us, that the case is one which was provided for by that act, since it docs not appear that any execution was issued by the magistrate, upon his own judgment  or if any did issue, that it was levied on the real estate of the debtor, and returned to the County Court. Be all this as it may, the ground o   the jurisdiction of the magistrate does not appear upon the face of the proceedings before him   without which, the Court must consider them as coram nonjudic . The cases of which he had cognizance, are-particularly enumerated in the f>2d section, before recited   and it appears, by the record given in evidence, that the demand sworn to by Sappington, was for 20 dollars and 25 cents, as appeared by the books of his intestate. But this was not the assertion of a cause of action, for   a balance due on any specialty, note or agreement, for money or specific articles, or for goods, wares and merchandise sold arid delivered, or for work and labour done.  It might have been for rent due, for money advanced, money received to the use of the plaintiff, and even for money claimed by the plaintiff as due ex debito, and charged in the books of the intestate. It is obvious, that the magistrate had no authority to take cognizance of these cases, and of others, which might be stated  and since his jurisdiction was strictly special and limited, it is essential to the validity of his judgment, and of the proceedings under it, that the record should show that he acted upon a ca.se which the law submitted t  his jurisdiction. The order of the County Court, for the sale of the defendant s land, having been founded upon this judgment} is exposed .to the same objection which applies to the judgment itself. If the judgment was void, an execution, or order of sale, founded upon it, was equally so. This Court must,- th refore, decide-, that the deed from the Sheriff to Sappington, under whom the defendant claims, was utterly void, having been made without any legal authority. 2. The next question is, whether,  nder the circumstances stated in the , bilL of exceptions, the possession of the defendant was protected by the statute of limitations of the State of Tennessee ? This statute, which passed iri the yepr 1797, enacts,   that in all cases wherever any person or -persons shall have had seven years peaceable possession of any land, by virtue of.a grant, or deed of conveyance, founded upon a grant, and no legal claim, by suit in law be set up to said land, within the above said term, that then, and in that case, the person, &c. &c. holding possession as aforesaid, shall be entitled to hold, possession, iri preference to all other claimants, of such quantity of land as shall be specified in his, her, or their said grant. or deed of conveyance, founded on a grant as aforesaid-  In the case of Patton's lessee v. Easton, (1 Wheat. Rep. 476.) a construction of the above act was given by this Court, in which it was decided, that a possession of seven years is a bar, only when it is held under a grant, or under, a deed founded on a grant  and that, as the defendant, in that case, showed no title under the trustees of the town of Nashville,.nor under any other grant, his seven years possession was insufficient to protect his title, or to bar that of the plaintiff, under a conveyance from the trustees. That was a stronger case for the defendant than the present  for in that the defendant gave in evidence a deed, for a valuable consideration, from Josiah Love to William T Lewis, at a time when the possession of the lane in controversy was vacant. That Lewis, immediately after the conveyance, took possession of the land, made valuable improvements thereon, and continued so possessed for about seventeen years, when he sold and conveyed the same to the defendant, who took and continued the possession until the ejectment was brought. Here, then, was an entry upon land in. the actual possession of no person, under a bona fide deed, and -a long continued possession under that title, which could not avail the defendant, because he could not trace a connected title up to a grant. In the present case, it appears, from the defendant s own showing, that Sappington, under whom he claims, had no title. If the defendant claims under a grant, or under mesae conveyances, which connect him with a grant, he gains a preference, by seven years possession, over all other claimants, however superior their title may be to his, independent of such possession. But this possession is of no value to him, unless he. can show such a title as is above described. The case of Harris and Holmes v. Bledsoe s lessee, decided by the Supreme Court of Errors and Appeals of the State of Tennessee, in January, 1821, of which a manuscript report was handed to the Court, seems in principle to be undistinguishable from the present, except that in that, the defendant connected himself with a grant  if the state of the case, which is very imperfectly set forth, in the opinion of one of the Judges, is rightly understood by this Court. But the infirmity of the defendant s title lay in one of the links of the chain, which was that of a deed from executors who had no power to sell and convey by the law, nor was it given by the will of the testator. Even a deed of confirmation, which was executed with a view to cure this defect in the title, was unavailing,   because,  to use the language of one of the Judges,   the act to be confirmed was void.  In the case before the Court, the defect in the defendant s chain of title, is the want of authority in the Sheriff to convey to Sappington, which rendered his deed absolutely void. The Court is, therefore, of opinion, that the Court below erred in stating to the jury that the deed to-Sappington, under the judgment of Sap-pington s administrator against Walker, was sufficient to vest the title of Walker in Sappington  and that the deeds referred to were of such a co-lour or appearance of title as, connected with seven years peaceable and continued possession, by the persons claiming under them, and the grant to Walker,. would- protect the possessor under the statute of limitations. It is deemed unnecessary to notice the third point, because, if the charge requires of a defendant more, than the law does, to entitle, him to the benefit of the seven years possession, it'is so far favourable to the plaintiff in error. It certainly does hot require of him less. . Neither does the Court notice the Sheriff s deed to Sappington for the lot in controversy, purchased by him at public auction, under process of the County Court, for non-payment of taxes, as that subject was not noticed by the.Judge, in his charge to the jury, and it can, therefore, present no question for the consideration Of this Court. Judgment reversed, and a venire facias de novo awarded. Judgment. This cause came on to be heard, &c. Qh consideration whereof, his Court, is of . opinion, that the said Circuit Court <n ed in stating to the jury that the deed to R. B. Sappington, under the . judgment of said M. B. Sappington s administrator against said Walker, was sufficient to vest.the title'of said Walker in said Sappington, and that the deeds referred to, were of such a co-lour or appearance of title, as, connected with 'seven years peaceable and continued possession, by the person claiming under them, and the grant to said Walker, would protect the-possession under the statute of limitations. It is, therefore, ordered and adjudged, that the judgment of the said Circuit Court in this case be, and' the same hereby, is reversed and annulled. attorneys:   corrections:  head_matter: [Local Law.]' Den ex dem.

By the statute of limitations of Tennessee, of 1797, a possession of seven yenis is a protection, only when held under a grant, or under mesne conveyances which connect it w ith a grant. A Sheriff s deed, which is void for- want of jurisdiction in the Court 'under whose judgmeht the sale took place, is not such a conveyance as that a. possession under it will'be protected by the statute of limitations.

      "judges:   parties:  John Knox, James Boggs, and James A. Knox, trading under the firm of Knox, Boggs, & Co., Appellants, v. Peyton Smith and others, Defendants. opinions:  Mr. Justice McLEAN delivered the opinion of the court. This is an appeal from the decree of the Circuit Court for the. District of West Tennessee. In their bill the complainants state that they recovered a judgment in the Circuit Court against Thomas Eckford and.Probert P. Collier, for the sum of three thousand four hundred and sixty-two dollars and twenty cents, &c.   and that execution was issued the 24th of April, 1840, which, about the 18th of July ensuing, was levied on sev nteen negroes and four mules  and that the rr .rsha . took a delivery bond and security, under the statute of T nnessee. That one Peyton Smith, a citizen of the State of T ennessee, pretending to claim said property levied upon by virtue of some fraudulent, .deed of trust executed by Probert P.w Collier to him, filed   bill,'which/prayed for an injunction, in the Circuit Court, and which was refused. That the delivery bond being forfeited, an execution was issued on it, against the principals and sureties, which was levied upon the same negroes and mules   upon which execution the marshal returned that u the property levied on had .been taken from him by the sheriff of Tipton county, under the order of the Chancery Court, at Brownsville, 5th December, 1840.  The bill alleges that the negroes and mules belonged to Collier, and it prays that they may be sold in satisfaction of the judgment. There is no allegation in this bill which authorizes a court of equity to take jurisdiction of the case. Fraud is not charged, nor is any thing stated going to show that the remedy at law is not complete. It is stated that Peyton Smith, pretending to claim the property, after the first levy, by. virtue of some fraudulent deed of trust executed to him by Collier, applied to the Circuit Court, by bill, for an injunction, which was refused. The present bill was not filed by the complainants until after execution was issued on the delivery bond and levied, and the property was taken, as returned by the marshal, under State process. Now, if the object had been to set aside the deed of trust, as fraudulent, the fraud, with the facte connected with it, should have been alleged in the bill. Or if the negroes and mules were about to be taken out of the State, and beyond the jurisdiction of the court, unless restrained by an' injunction, such fact should have been stated. But the principal allegation in the bill is, that under the State authority the sheriff had no right to take the negroes, &c. If this be admitted, it does not follow that the remedy of the complainants is in a court of equity. On the contrary, from the showing in the bill, there is a plain remedy at law. The marshal might have brought trespass against the sheriff, or applied to the Circuit Court for an attachment. Out of the answer which sets up the deed of trust, the complainants insist they are entitled to relief. Now no relief can be given by a court of equity, except a proper case be made in the bill. The inquiry is not only whether the defendant, from his own showing or by proof, has acted unjustly and inequitably, but also, whether the complainants, by their allegations and proof, have shown that they are entitled to relief. The decree of the Circuit Court is affirmed, with costs. attorneys:  The case .was argued by Mr-. Brinley, for' the appellants, and Mr. Milton Brown, for the appellees.

A bill in chancery which recites, that the complainants had recovered a judgment at law in a court of the United States, upon which an execution had issued and been levied upon certain property by the marshal  that another person, claiming to hold the property levied upon by virtue of some fraudulent deed of trust, had obtained a process from a State court, by which the sheriff had taken the property out of the hands of the marshal  and praying that the property might be sold, cannot be sustained. 1 If the object had been to set aside the deed of trust, as fraudulent, the fraud, with the facts connected with it, should have been alleged in the bill. There exists a plain remedy at law. The marshal might have brought trespass against the sheriff, or applied to the court of the United States for an attachment. No relief can be given by a court of equity, unless the coinplainant, by his allegations and prooij has shown that he-is entitled to relief. This was an appeal from the Circuit Court of the United States for the District of West Tennessee, sitting as a court of equity. The appellants had filed a bill against the defendants, which bill was-dismissed by the Circuit Court. The facts in the case were these. On the 23d of March, 1839, Probert P. Collier, of the county of Tipton and State of Tennessee, executed to Peyton Smith, of the same State, a deed of trust, reciting the indebtedness of Collier to sundry persons, and proceeding as follows :      Now, the above-named creditors, to wit, Robert B. Clarkson, Jordan Brown, Isaac Killough, Stephen Smith, James D. Holmes, Samuel A. Holmes, Joseph T. Collier, and Forsythe, Goodwin, & Co., merchants of New Orleans, being willing to wait and give the further indulgence of  eighteen months longer from the date of this indenture with the said Probert P. Collier, upon having their debts and the interest accruing thereon   and the said Probert P. Collier being willing to give them a certain assurance that their money shall be paid at the expiration of eighteen months from this date   and the said Probert P. Collier being extremely desirous to save harmless and secure from all liabilities his indorsers as above described on the several notes already specified in this indenture as such indorsers. .

On the 4th .of December, 1839,- Knox, Boggs, & Co,, citizens of Pennsylvania, brought a suit in the District Court of the United States, possessing Circuit Court jurisdiction, and sitting for the District of West Tennessee, against Thomas Eckford and Probert P. Collier, as indorsers of sundry promissory notes held by Knox, Boggs, & Co. On the 8th of April, 1840, a judgment was rendered against these defendants in the above court, for the sum of $ 3,56^*20. On the 24 th of April, 1840, a writ of fieri facias, founded on the foregoing judgment, was issued, and the execution levied on seventeen negroes and four mules, as the property of P. P. Collier, being a part of the property included within the deed to Peyton Smith. A forthcoming bond was.taken, with the following condition : -    Now, if the said P. P. Collier shall deliver the property at Covington,, on the 21st day of September, 1840, then and there to be sola to satisfy said judgment and cost, then this obligation to be void   else, to remain in full force.

SMITH, [seal.]  About this time, although the record does not say precisely when, Smith, the trustee, applied to the judge , of the District Court for an injunction to. restrain the sale, upon the ground that the property belonged to him and not to Collier, but the judge declined to gran, it. He then applied to the Chancery Court at Brownsville (a State court of Tennessee), and, upon filing his bill for relief, obtained ah injunction.  On the 21st of September, 1840, when the property was to be delivered under the forthb ming bond, the marshal made the following return..

On the 27th of October, 1840, an alias fieri facias was issued Upon the judgment in the District Court,'- and placed in the hands of the marshal, who levied-it, on the 6th of November, upon the same negroes and mules which were the subjects of the former execution. Another forthcoming bond was given for the delivery of the property on the 5th of December, 1840. On the 20th of N.oveniber, 1840, .the Chancery Court at Brownsville issued the following order.   State of Tennessee : To the Sheriff of Tipton County, greeting : . {  Whereas, it hath been represented unto the chancellor, in our  Chancery Court af Brownsville, in the western division of the State of Tennessee aforesaid, on the part of Peyton Smith, trustee, &c., complainant,' that he has lately exhibited his amended bill of complaint in our said Chancery Court,   against Knox, Boggs, & Co., P. P. Collier, and Robert J. Chester, defendants, to b  relieved touching the matters therein complained of  in which said bill it is, among other matters, set forth, that the said defendants are combining and confederating to injure the complainant touching the matters set forth in said bill, and that their actings and doings in that behalf are contrary to equity and good conscience.   We, therefore, in consideration of tire premises, do strictly command you, the said'sheriff of Tipton county, Tennessee, that you do absolutely seize and take into your possession, immediately and forthwith, at all hazards, the following negro slaves, to wit: Jack, Jim, Jane, Marcella, Zilpha, Washington, Margaret, Doll,-Bryant, Toney, Catharine, Cully, - Cynthia, Sam, John, Clara, and  Lucinda, heretofore levied on by the marshal of West Tennessee, as the property of said Collier, to satisfy a judgment in favor of' said Knox, Boggs, & Co.   and do you safely and s'ecurely keep said slaves, so that you have them forthcoming to abide the' further order of our said Chancery Court   and this- you shall in no wise omit, under the penalty prescribed by law.   11 Witness, Sheppard M.

R0B  J  CHESTER, Mar-   5th Dec., 1840. On the 8th of April, 1841,' Knox, Boggs, & Co. filed a bill in the District Court of the United States (the same pourt in which they had obtained their judgment), reciting all the circumstances of the. case, stating that Smith claimed under a fraudulent deed of trust, and alleging that a State court had no right, power, or jurisdiction to enjoin the process issued fromth  District Court  , that Collier and the securities upon the delivery bond combined and confederated with Peyton Smith to prevent the sale of the property levied upon, and so defeat the execution of the complainants, who had now no adequate and complete remedy at law. The bill prayed that. Collier and Smith and all the securities, might be made defendants to answer, and that the property might be sold to pay the judgment obtained by the complainants. Some of the defendants demurred to the bill, but the demurrers were overruled, and they were ordered to answer. On the 10th of November, 1841, the Chancery Court at Brownsville passed., the following decree in the case of the bill which had been filed by Peyton Smith, and in which he had obtained an injunction, as before stated.   Be it remembered, that this cause came on to be heard on this, the tenth day of November, eighteen hundred and forty-one, before the Hon. A. McCampbell, chancellor, upon the orders pro confesso against said defendants. And it appearing to the satisfaction of the court, that in March, eighteen hundred and thirty-nine, defendant Collier made a deed conveying to complainant, amongst other things, the following negro slaves, to-wit :  Jack, Jim, Washington, Margaret, Doll, Marcella, Zilpha, Bryan,   Toney, Catharine, Cully, Ghloe, Phillis, Sam, John, Lucinda, and Cynthia   which said deed was executed by said Collier to complainant in trust to secure the payment of certain debts in the same specified   and by the terms of said deed said Collier' was to remain in possession of the property conveyed in the same for the space of eighteen months from and after the execution of said deed   and in the event that the debts specified in said deed were not paid on or before the expiration of the eighteen months from the time of the execution of said deed, the property specified in the same was to be sold by complainant, and. the proceeds arising from said sale to be applied by him to the liquidation and settlement of the debts set forth in said deed.   And it further appearing, that said deed was duly proven and registered, and that the debts specified in said deed are bona fide, and due and owing, with the exception of about five hundred-dollars, which has been paid by said Collier since the execution of said deed   and that said deed was executed in good faith, and there is nb fraud in the same.   And.it further appearing to the satisfaction of the court, that  fter   the execution, probate, and registration of said deed, defendants Knox, Boggs, & Co. recovered a judgment' in the District Court of the United States, in the eighth circuit, for the State of Tennessee, at Jackson, for about the sum of three thousand four hundred and sixty-two dollars and twenty cents  upon which said judgment a writ of fieri facias issued to defendant Chester   who, by virtue of said writ of-fieri facias, seized and took into his possession said negro slaves, Jack, Jim, Washington, Doll, Marcella, Zilpha, Bryant, Toney, Catharine, Cully, Chloe, Phillis, Cynthia, Sam, John, and Lucinda, and that defendant Chester was about to sell and dispose of said negroes slaves.   And it further appearing to the satisfaction of the court, that defendants acquired no lien on any of said several negroes slaves by virtue of their said judgment and execution  and that said slaves ought not to be appropriated .in satisfaction of the same.   It is therefore ordered, adjudged, and decreed by the court', that the injunction heretofore awarded in this cause be made perpetual  and that said defendants Knox, Boggs, & Co., and said Robert J. Chester, be, arid are hereby, restrained perpetually from selling or otherwise controlling either of said slaves under and by virtue of said judgment and execution.   It is further ordered, that the sheriff of Tipton county deliver said negroes over to complainant  that complainant pay all costs herein expended, for which execution may issue. And that complainant recover of defendants Knox, Boggs, & Co., and Robert J. Chester, the costs of- suit herein expended  and that defendant Collier recover of complainant the cost by him about this suit expended   for which executions may issue.  In April, 1842, the respondents answered the bill filed by Knox, Boggs, & Co. in the District Court. It will .only be necessary to refer to the answers of Smith and Collier.   Smith denied that the deed of trust made to him was fraudulent as against creditors, but averred that the same was made in good faith   that he was governed by no other feeling or desire than a wish to discharge his duty as trustee   that the cestui que trust looked to him to protect the property   denied all combination and confederation with any person, &c., &c. Collier admitted the truth of the facts as they are set forth in the preceding part of this statement, denied that the deed to Smith was fraudulent, but averred that it was made in good faith, &c., &c. In May, 1842, a general replication was filed by the complainants. On the 5 th of August, 1842,' interrogatories were filed on the part of the complainants, and the depositions of four person, taken. Chester, the marshal, was asked to state the value of the property conveyed by the deed of trust, to which he answered' as' follows. Answer.    I believe, from the ages, &o , of the negroes mentioned in the deed of trust, and what I saw of them when delivered to me, that they were worth, at the date of conveyance, seven to eight thousand dollars I do not know what the. mules and horses are worth, nor am I acquainted with the Value, of the land or the town lots.  . Harris and Smith answered as follows. Answer.  I, J. W. Harris, have examined the deed referred to in said interrogatory, and suppose the negroes, judging from their age and size, as stated in said deed of trust, to have been worth, at the date o*f said deed, seven thousand six hundred and fifty dollars   not being personally acquainted with but few of them, can only state their value from what appears to be their ages in the deed. Horses and mules supposed to .be worth four hundred dollars   household and kitchen furniture supposed to be worth four hundred and eleven dollars, including spinning-machine, barouche, blacksmith s tools, and loom. As to the land, I have no idea what it was worth, never having been upon it that I know of, and not being acquainted with the value of land.      I, A. W. Smith, answer and say, that I am acquainted with the property conveyed in the deed mentioned in the above interrogatory, and believe it to have been worth, at the date of the said deed, ten thousand thre  hundred and sixty-six dollars.  Clarkson was interrogated as to the amount which Collier owed to him, to which he responded, that it was a balance of eleven or twelve hundred dollars. On the 16th of October, .'  43, the cause came on to be heard on bill, answers, replication, and proof, when the bill was dismissed, with costs. From which decree an appeal brought the case up to this court. The case .was argued by Mr-. Brinley, for' the appellants, and Mr. Milton Brown, for the appellees. Mr. Brinley, for the appellants.  It may -be proper to make two statements, preliminary to arguing the points which are most material. The one is, that the original action was instituted in the District Court of the United States for West Tennessee. That was a correct proceeding, because that court had Circuit Court jurisdiction imposed upon it by the act of January 18th, 1839. 5 Lit. & Brown s ed. 313. The other remark is, that the delivery bonds adverted to were taken in conformity to the laws of Tennessee. They provide, that when any execution may be levied on real or personal property, if the debtor shall give sufficient security to the officer to have the goods and chattels forthcoming at the day and place of sale, it shall be the duty of the officer to take a bond payable to the creditor for double the amount of execution, reciting the service of the execution, and the amount of the money due thereon, conditioned for the true performance of the same. Laws of Tennessee, 1801, ch, 13 (Caruthers & Nicholson s Compilation, 129). The act of Tenness e of 1831, ch. 25, provides, in the first section, that the- securities in such a bond, if forfeited, shall not be responsible for more than the value of the property. The second section provides, that if an execution be, levied upon personal property, and bond and security shall be given for the delivery of the property upon the, day of sale, and the bond shall be forfeited, in whole or in part, then the officer shall proceed to levy upon so much of the defendant s property as maybe found, as shall be  sufficient to satisfy the. execution   if he finds no property of the defendant, then he shall levy upon property of the security or securities in said forfeited delivery bond. Laws of Tennessee (Caruthers & Nicholson s Compilation), 129. Let us now pass to the consideration of the points arising out of an examination of the deed of trust. It is dated March 14th, 1839   and by it Collier conveys to Smith six parcels of real estate, negroes, horses, mules, furniture, and other property, in trust, to pay certain notes with, interest, provided they are not paid by said Collier, or some other person for him, before the   expiration of eighteen months from the date of. the deed   if not paid by that time, Smith is to sell the property at auction for ready money. By the deed, Collier is to keep and retain the land and personal property in his own possession until the expiration of said eighteen months. The deed is made to secure the paymert of twelve notes, amounting to a trifle over $ 6,000. The value of the property conveyed, according to the testimony of Smith, is $ 10,366. Such an amount of property conveyed to secure, not all, but a portion, of'Collier s creditors, without any.stipulations for a release, indicates fraud in regard to other creditors   .more especially as there is no proof of the validity of the debts. By the laws of Tennessee, every gift, &c., made with the intent, to delay or defraud creditors of their just and lawful actions, suits, debts, &c., are wholly and utterly void, except as against the person making the same. Act of 1801, ch. 25,   2. Again  the deed of trust had matured before the second levy, of the plaintiff s execution, and the property remained in the hands of the debtor   that is, the trustee had not taken possession of it at the time limited for the payment of the money. There was no proof that the trust was bona fide. The legal presumption upon this state of facts is, that the trust i  fraudulent and void as to creditors, and the onus lies on the trustee to prove the contrary, and to prove the validity of the debts. Possession remaining with the vendor, after an absolute sal , or with the grantor or mortgagor in deeds of trust and mortgage, after the time when the debt secured by the latter should be paid, is prima facie evidence of fraud   but the presumption of fraud may be repelled by proof of fairness in the transaction, and that the instruments were executed for an adequate consideration. Maney v. Killough, 7 Yerger, 440. The marshal, therefore, had a right to levy on the slaves as the property of the debtor. The property had been levied on by the marshal, on the first execution, and a bond taken before the  trust matured, and the bond was forfeited. But that did not prevent the trustee from taking possession of the negroes after the bond was forfeited   because a forfeiture of 'the bond released the property from all lien or liability on account of the levy, and it again became a part of the debtor s general property, and might have deen taken by the trustee, without legal hindrance, so far as the first levy was concerned. Where an execution is levied, and bond taken for the delivery of the property on the day of sale, the lien of the execution continues until the bond is forfeited. It is then discharged, and the property is subject to the claims of other creditors. Malone . Abbott, 3 Humphrey, 532. The levy of the marshal was therefore valid as against the trust, which, for want of proof to the contrary, was fraudulent. This levy vested the title in the marshal for the benefit of the plaintiffs, to pay their debt by execution   it was a lien , created by law, which could not be enforced at law, because the marshal was forcibly prevented by the interference of the State tribunals, called into existence by the defendants. Their only remedy was in equity to enforce their lien, to prevent multiplicity of suits, conflicts of jurisdiction, an^to inquire into the fraudulent conveyance by the deed pf trust. A judgment creditor, haying a lien on personal property, has a right to come into chancery to remove obstacles thrown in the way of the due execution of his process by a levy and. seizure, of the property by a junior judgment creditor. Parrish  . Saunders et al., 3 Humphrey, 431. This is an analogous case. The courts of Tennessee have decided, that a suit in equity can be brought for slaves, from the peculiar nature of the property. Loftin v. Espy, 4 Yerger, 84. A fortiori, to enforce a lien upon them. Lastly   the State court had no authority to enjoin an execution issuing from a court of the United States. McKim v. Voorhies, 7 Cranch, 279   3 Story on the Constitution, 625,    1751, 1752   United States v. Wilson, 8 Wheat. 253   1 Kent s Comm. 409. It is true that the .national courts have no authority (in-cases not within the appellate jurisdiction of the United States) to issue injunctions to judgments in the State courts   or in any other manner to interfere with their jurisdiction or proceedings. 3 Story on the Constitution, 626,   1753   Diggs et al. v. Wolcott, 4 Cranch, 179. But the federal court had complete jurisdiction in this case, by injunction, to prevent the sale of tHe property levied upon by execution from its court. Parker t>. The Judges of the Circuit Court of Maryland, 12 Wheat. 561. And as the State and federal courts had concurrent jurisdiction (Act of September 24th, 1789,  11  1 Lit, & Brown s ed. 78) of the action brought at law, and the .suit in equity which arose out of it, the federal court having first acquired jurisdiction, the same cannot afterwards be taken from it by the State courts. Under such circumstances, the aid of the United .States court is not an irregular interference with the proceedings of the State tribunal. If the State courts have jurisdiction to enjoin the-marshal from selling specific property in possession of the defendant, they may enjoin for all his property, or for any number of adverse claimants   and thus, in effect, entirely defeat the plaintiff s execution. . At. the same .time, an injurious conflict of jurisdiction would be produced, inconsistent with the harmony which ought to exist between the State and federal jurisdictions.  Where the-jurisdiction of the federal courts has once attached, no subsequent change in the relation or condition of the parties will oust' the jurisdiction.' The strongest considerations of utility and convenience  require that, the jurisdiction being once vested, the action of the court shall not be limited, but that it should proceed to make a final disposition of the-subject.  United States v. Myers, et al., 2 Brockenbrough s Rep. 516. Mr. Milton Brown, for the appellees. The principal and leading question in this case arises on the demurrer to the bill  for if this be adjudged for the appellees, there is an end of the case. The bill, if its allegations be true, states a case.of clear and unembarrassed remedy at law. When analyzed, it amounts to this:  That complainants had recovered a'judgment at law, on which execution issued, and had been levied by the marshal of West Tennessee, on seventeen negroes and four mules, the property of Collier, one of the debtors in the execution, for the forthcoming of which, on the day of sale, a delivery bond had been taken, with sureties.^ -That onC Peyton Smith had applied to the Circuit Court of the United States, from which the execution had issued, for an injunction to restrain the sale of said negroes   which application, however, was refused by the coyrt. That afterwards, the property not having been delivered on the day of sale, the bond was forfeited   and on this judgment of forfeiture another execution issued against die defendants .in the original judgment, and. also the sureties in the forfeited delivery bend   on which last execution another levy was made, and another del very bond, with new surety, taken. Tlie bill then adds :     Upon this last execution the marshal made the following return : The property executed, delivered according to bolid, and then arrested from me by the sheriff of Tip-ton, under order of the Chancery Court at Brownsville, 5tb December, 1840.  The next two paragraphs then disclose the points on which the supposed equity of the bill is made to rest. They ara as follows-.   And your orators further show, that the said Peyton Smith, although your honor refused to grant an injunction restraining the sale of said negroes levied upon, has, by some means or other, procured from the State courts of the State of Tennessee a process of injunction  or some other process, enjoining the sale of said negroes and property levied upon by virtue of the executions issuing from your honorable court, and has procured one Josiah Horne, the sheriff of Tipton county, a citizen of the State of Tennessee, to arrest and take possession of said negroes from the custody of the marshal of this court  and the said Josiah Horne has still possession of said property so levied upon as aforesaid, and refuses to deliver the same to the marshal, of the Western District, to be sold according to law.  Your orators further show, that said negroes and mules were the property of said Probert P. Collier, and liable to be sold for the debt due to your orators, and that the State courts had no right, power, or jurisdiction to enjoin the process issued, from this honorable court  and your orators believe, and so charge, that the said Collier and the securities upon said delivery bond combined and confederated with said Peyton Smith to prevent the sale of the property levied upon, and so defeat the execution of your orators   and your orators have now no adequate and complete remedy at law.  On tnese vague  uncertainties and allegations, meaning nothing and amounting to nothing, the debtors in the original judgment, the sureties to both the delivery bonds, and Peyton Smith and the sheriff of Tipton, are all made defendants. And it is only remarkable, that in this wholesale business, the chancellor of West Tennessee was not included. The prayer of the hill for specific relief is,   1. That the negroes   be sold to pay the judgment d e to your orators.  2.   That said defendants be jointly and severally bound personally to pay said judgment and interest to your orators.  And lastly,     That said negroes be forthcoming, to abide the decree of this honorable court.  An injunction was.prayed for, but not granted. To this bill the defendants severally demurred. The demurrers were overruled by the court below, and the defendants required to answer. And now comes up the question, whether there is suffix cient equity in the bill, and stated with sufficient legal certainty, to authorize a decree to be made on it. And first, as to the defendant Peyton Smith, against whom there is equity, if against any one. The point is, the improper suing out of process and arresting the property from the possession or the marshal. If it be the design of the bill to invoke the chancery powers of the court, to control or decide any real or supposed conflict between the federal and State judiciaries, the exercise of such a power would be alike unwarranted and dangerous. But this is probably not the object of the bill. It proceeds on the ground that the process was wholly and absolutely void. What the process was, whether an injunction or a final process of execution, either in law or chancery, is not stated. The vague and unmeaning allegation is, that it was   a process of injunction, or some other process.  Nor is it stated on what this very uncertain process was sued out, or on what it was founded  whether on a final decree in . chancery, on a final judgment at law, or on an  pplication for an injunction, does not appear with any degree of legal certainty. The allegations are, that said Peyton Smith,   by some means or other,   procured from the State courts of the State of Tennessee a. process of injunction, or some other process,  by which the sale of the slaves by the marshal had been prevented  and that the State courts   had no' right, power, or jurisdiction   to issue this process. Nqw, if these allegations be true, the process, whatever it might be, was absolutely void, and all acting under it trespassers. The marshal should have paid no attention to it  and if the property was taken without his consent, an action of trespass or trover, in his name, by virtue of his levy, was the plain remedy 1 If the process in the hands of the marshal was, as is here alleg d, wrongfully and unlawfully obstructed or interfered with, it certainly furnishes no ground on which to invoke the chancery powers of the court. The case would be much nearer the province of a grand jury than the conscience of a chancellor. In this it is not designed to intimate, that, in point of fact, there was any unlawful or improper interference with the rights of the marshal or the complainants. Nor is it designed to intimate that there was any conflict of jurisdiction between the federal and State courts. It is believed there was no such interference, and no such conflict. But for the purposes of the argument on the deniurr r, the facts are taken as stated in the bill. The attempt in the appellant s brief to sustain the bill, on the ground of its being filed to set aside a fraudulent deed of trust, finds no support in the allegations or frame of the bill itself. The case made in the bill is the alleged improper issuance of thh process from the State courts, and the seizure of the property. On what this process issued, as already clearly shown, is not stated. There is nothing on the face of the bill to show, with sufficient legal certainty, .that the existence of a deed of trust is the subject of complaint. .   Every material fact to which the plaintiff means to offer evidence ought to be distinctly stated in the premises.  Story s Eq. PI.  28. If fraud is charged, it must be distinctly'and clearly set out. Story s Eq. PI.   251. The only reference in the bill to a deed of trust is a mere, historical reference in the statement that Peyton Smith had applied to the Circuit Court of the United States for an injunction, which was refused. It is not charged that any other or further use was ever made or intended to be made of it. Before the issuance of the   process   from the State courts, of which complaint is made, there had, as appears on the face of the bill, been an entire change in the nature of the question. The delivery bond had been forfeited, a new statutory judgment bad attached, a new execution had issued, embracing not merely the former defendants, but the sureties in the delivery bond also, a new levy under this execution had been made, &c., &c. This   process,  therefore, which is spoken of in the bill in such remarkably indefinite terms, might h ve been founded on an intervening judgment or decree in chancery, taking priority of lien, p's happened in the case of Brown v. Clarke, decided at die present term of this court. In that, case it was decided that, on the forfeiture of a delivery bond, the first lien was extinguished and a new lien attached, and that intervening liens might take precedence. May this not have been the case in this very instance,, so far as any thing appears on the face of the bill ? In fact, the language of the bill favors this conclusion. It says that,   by some means or other,  process. was sued out. Does this not leave it wholly uncertain whether this process was obtained by  means  of a deed-of trust, or by that   other   means referred to ? But again   the bill says there was sued out   a process of injunction, or some other process,  thus leaving it entirely uncertain what that   other process  was. Might not that   other process   here referred to have been founded on an intervening judgment or decree, creating a prior lien, and entitled to prior satisfaction ? These considerations are deemed sufficient to show that the reference to the deed of trust in the bill is too indefinite and uncertain to require an answer, or form an issue, and can furnish no possible ground for equitable interference. A statement of facts, to form the,basis of relief, must not be vague and uncertain. And if, as in this case, they are stated in the alternative, or are otherwise left doubtful, it is such uncertainty as will be bad on general demurrer. Story s.Eq. PI.    243-249 and 450. Upon what ground the sureties in the delivery bonds have, been made parties it is hard to perceive. Complainants alreadv If^d judgments and executions against them on the forfeiture  what more did they want ? There is nothing in the bill against them, except a general charge of combination and confederacy, which cannot be a sufficient ground of jurisdiction   and, if charged, need not be answered. Story s Eq. Pi.    29 and 856. If the demurrers are sustained by the court, there is, of course, an end of the case   should they be overruled, another question presents itself. Can the reference to a deed of trust, in the answer, put that in issue which was not substantially relied on in the bill ? That it cannot is clear. Gresley on Ev. 22   Story s Eq. Pl.   36, in note  Boone v. Chiles, 10 Peters, 209   Harrison and others v. Nixon, 9 Peters, 503   Jackson v. Ashton, 11 Peters, 249. In this last case the court say,     It may be proper to observe, that no admissions in an answer  an, under any circumstances, lay the foundation for relief under any specific head of equity, unless it be substantially set forth in the biU.  But there is another reason why the statement in the answers, in the present condition of the' case, cannot be regarded. The real persons interested in the deed of trust are not made parties   and this may also be regarded as another proof that the bill is framed with a view to no such end. Peyton Smith is a mere trustee, without interest  his answer cannot prejudice the rights of the cestuis que trust  and, though a party of record, is a competent witness. Gresiey on Ev. 242, 258. The true rule seems to be, that the cestuis que trust should be made'parties in all cases where the  existence or enjoyment of the property is affected by the prayer of the suit.  Calvert on Parties, 212. To make,' therefore, the admissions or statements in the answers of those having no interest in the trust work an injury'to those who hold the real interest, would be to violate not merely the established'rules of pleading and evidence, but the most obvious rules of substantial justice. While it is believed that this is the law of the case, and that no decree, on several grounds, can be made touching the rights of the cestuis que trust, it is, with equal confidence, believed that there is not the slightest ground to infer fraud in the execution of the trust. It was designed to give a preference to Collier s own creditors over debts for which he was a mere security. This, he had a lawful right to do. The debts designed to be preferred amounted to over seven thousand dollars, besides interest. The highest estimate placed on all the property is $ 10,366. But this is palpably an overestimate, as is proved by the fact that one witness says the seventeen negroes were worth   7,650     while another witness thinks they were worth seven or eight thousand, dollars. And yet the face of the bill shows, that the same negroes were valued on each levy by the marshal when inserted in the delivery bonds   the first time valued at $ 4,100,  nd the last time at $ 4,250. This proves that the estimate attempted to be placed on the' property, for the purposes of this cause, is entirely too high. It is believed that at, no time would it have sold under the hammer for enough tb meet the debts named in the deed of trust. One other suggestion will close this brief. The' question of the validity t>f this d ed has been before the Chancery Court of the 'State, where the parties in interest have been properly represented, and the result has been a decision in favor of the rights of the eestuis que trust  and it is' fair to suppose that the trust, under the direction of the court, has, before now, been wound up, and justice done. Mr. Brinley, in reply. 1. It is insisted by the counsel for the appellees, that there, was. a remedy at law  that if the property was taken from' the marshal without his consent, he had a remedy by action of trespass or trover. This objection is anticipated and met in the opening argument for the appellants. 2. It is contended that there were too many persons made defendants by the bill. Who are they ? Peyton Smith, the person claiming the, property under an alleged fraudulent deed of trust  Collier, the assignor in said deed. The former should be included beyond a doubt  so, too, the latter. Where the assignment is not absolute and unconditional, or there are remaining rights or liabilities of the assignor, which may be affected by the decree, there the assignor is not only a proper, but a necessary, party. Story on Eq. PI.   153. Eckford, being one of the judgment debtors, was of course a party. Bryan, Feezer, and Smith were securities on the delivery bond given on the levy of the first execution  they, together with Boon, were securities on the delivery bond given on the levy of the second execution.. They were all made parties to the bill, on the principle that those in interest must be brought into court. . By the statutes of Tennessee, as sureties to a forfeited delivery bond, their property might be levied o , and they had a direct interest in the subject. Besides, they were distinctly charged in the bill as confederating with Collier and Smith to prevent the sale of the property levied on. Horne was the sheriff who arrested the property from the marshal, and he was therefore made a party.' This   wholesale business  was but a compliance with the rules of equity applicable to the circumstances. . 3. It is then contended that there are not parties enough  that the cestuis que trust are not included. It may be true, as a general rule, that all persons interested in the subject of a suit should be made parties as plaintiffs or defendants, in order that a complete decree may be made  but there are exceptions. Thus, residuary legatees are interested in the object of a suit by a creditor against the executor, to establish his debt or claim against the estate  for the establishment of such debt or claim goes pro tanto in direct diminution of their interest in the residue. Yet they are never required to be parties. Calvert on Parties, ch. 1, p. 5. So trustees for the payment of debts and legacies may sustain a suit either* as plaintiffs or defendants, touching the trust estate, without bringing the creditors or legatees before the court as parties. Fenn v. Craig, 3 Younge and Collier, 2161 In case of assignment for benefit of creditors, the assignees may file a bill relative to the trust estate, without making t&e creditors parties   for the assignees are the proper representatives of all of them. In a suit to set aside an assignment as fraudulent, it is sufficient to make, the fraudulent assignors and assignees parties. Wakeman t . Grover, 4 Paige, 23. In the present case, Smith, the trustee,- must be considered as the representative of the interest of all parties. It was not necessary to make the cestuis que trust parties   the complainants knew not who they were. Memo tenetur divinare. 4. The bill is said to be vague and unmeaning, because it states that   a process of injunction, or some other process,  enjoining the sale, proceeded from the State court. The bill states, in the words of the return on the fi. fa., that the property was arrested from the marshal   under order of the Chancery Court at Brownsville.  It then states, in the next paragraph, in reference to this order and arrest, that it was by  an injunction or some othfer process.  If the language of the return had been used in that paragraph, it would'have been sufficiently certain.  the alternative phrase employed is not less so. The sections in Story on Eq. PI.-, referred to by the counsel for the appellees, are to the point, that when the allegations in a bill are extremely vague, loose, and uncertain, or where the title of a plaintiff is stated in the alternative, so that the respondent does not know what he is to answer, they are not sufficient. A general charge or statement of the matters of fact is sufficient, and it is not necessary to charge minutely all the circumstances which may conduce to a general charge  Story on Eq. PI.  28,, Here the general charge is, that the sale.on the execution was enjoined by process from the State court, and the property arrested from the marshal. That is minute enough, particularly as the precise character and appellation of the process were known to Smith, who obtained it. Moreover, a charge in general terms, where it is the point on which the merits of the cause turn, and does not come in' collaterally and incidentally, will warrant the production of evidence to particular facts. 2 Atk. 333, 337. A plaintiff is not bound to set forth all die minute facts which go to constitute a charge   and where the title to relief will be precisely the same in each case, the plaintiff may aver facts of a different nature, which wijl equally support his application. Story on Eq. PI.    252, 254. The cases cited by the counsel for the appellees, from the reports of this court, are to die undisputed point, that a party is not allowed to state one case in a bill or answer, and make out a different one by proof. No such attempt is made in this case the allegation in substance is,-that an injunction, or a process of like nature issued   that is put in issue. The proof, as obtained from the admissions in the answers of Smith, Collier, Feezer, Bryan, Horne, and Booner is within the allegation, that an injunction issued. In the case of Jackson v. Ashton, 11 Peters, 249, the court said,     The answer of the defendant is broader than the allegations in the bill  and, although such parts of the answer as are not responsive to the bill are not evidence for the defendant, yet the counsel on both sides have considered the facts disclosed as. belonging to the case  and if the facts in the answer,-not responsive to the bill, are relied on by the complainants  counsel as admissions by the defendant, he is entitled, thus far, to their full benefit.  So here the counsel, throughout the progress of the cause, have considered the fact that an injunction issued as belonging to the case. It was disclosed (admit it for the argument) in the answer of Smith, though not substantially set forth in the bill  -yet the complainants shall have the full benefit of the admission. The words,   or other process,  may be considered surplusage. 5. It is sajd there is nothing on the face of the bill to show that the deed, of trust was the subject of complaint. The bill expressly states, that Smith claimed the property under a fraudulent deed of trust, and that he pursued that claim by the intervention of the State court. An illegal proceeding, based on a fraudulent conveyance, is the charge. The reference to the deed of trust is said to be in the statement. There it ought to be   for the. statement constitutes the real substance of a bill. Story on Eq. PI.   27. 6. The   process   from the State court, it is argued, may have been founded on an intervening judgment, creating a prior lien, &c. Such a supposition is wholly at war with the true state of the case, as disclosed by the allegations in the bill, and the admissions in the answers. 7. The counsel for the appellees states, that u the highest estimate placed on all the property is $ 10.366     and therefore there is no reason for inferring fraud. Fraud may not be conclusively established from that circumstance only   but it is one of a number of circumstances which unitedly afford strong presumption of fraud in regard to creditors. 8. The closing remark of the counsel for die appellees, that the validity of the deed of trust has been established by the court of chancery of the State, is, as it purports to be, a   suggestion,  and which cannot affect the decision of this court.\n",

      "judges:   parties:  Lessee of William A. Powell, and others vs. John Harman. opinions:  Mr Chief Justice Mahshall. delivered the opinion of the Court. The question now. referred to this Court differs from that which >was decided in Patton s lessee vs. Easton, 1 Wheat. 476, in this, that the defendant who sets up a possessidn of s^Vjen years in bar of the plaintiff s title, endeavours to connect'himself with a grant. The sale and conveyance however, by which this connexion is to be formed, are admitted to be void. The conveyance being made by a person having no authority to make it, is of no validity, and cannot conn ct the purchaser with the original grant. We are therefore of opinion that the law is for the plaintiff and that this be certified as the opinipn of this Court. This cause came on to be heard on a certificate of division of opinion of the judges of the circuit court of the United States for the district-of west Tennessee,  nd on the questions and points on which the said judges of that court were divided in opinion/and which have been certified to this Court  and was argued by counsel: on consideration whereof, this Court is of opinion, that under the statute of limitations of Tennessee, of seventeen hundred and ninety seven, a possession of seven years is a protection only when held under a grant or under valid rhesne conveyafices  dr a paper title, which are legally or equitably connected with a grqnt  : and that a void deed' is not such a conveyance, as that a possession Under it will be protected under the statute of limitations   all which is directed and ordered to be certified, to the said circuit court of the United States, for the seventh circuit and district of west Tennessee. attorneys:   corrections:  head_matter: Lessee of William A. Powell, and others vs. John Harman. Under the statute of limitations of Tennessee, qf>seventeen hundred and ninety-seven, a possession of seven* years-is a protection only \\fchen held under a- * grant, or under valid mesne conveyances, or a paper title, which are legally or equitably connected with a grant  and a void deed is not such. a conveyance as that a possession under it will be protected by the statute of limitations. THIS case came before the'Court from the circuit court of western Tennessee, on a certificate of division from the judges of that court. In the court below, the lessor of the plaintiff showed a regular title to the lands in question, under a grant from the state of North Carolina  and proved that the defendant was in possession of the land in dispute . The defendant proved  that he had been in peaceable possession of the land for more than seven years, holding adversely to the plaintiff, under a'deed from the sheriff of Montgomery bounty, dated the 14th of April 1808, founded upon a sal  for tax s  but which sale was admitted to foe void, because the requisites of the law- in regard to the sale of lands for taxes, had not' been complied with. Upon the trial'of this caus , it occurred as a question, whether, under the statute of limitations of Tennessee of 1797, a possession of seven years is a protection only when held under' a grant or under valid mesne conveyances, or a paper title, which are legally or equitably connected with a grant  or whether a possession under a void deed is such a  conveyance, as that a possession under it will be protected by the statute of limitations. The judges being opposed upon this question, it was  referred- to  this Court for their opinion.\n",

The Lessee of Henry Neal, Defendant in Error. opinions:  The facts of the case are fully stated in the opinion of the Court, delivered by Mr Justice M Lean. This writ of error is prosecuted to reverse a judgment of the circuit court for West Tennessee. An action of ejectment was prosecuted by Neal in that court, to recover the possession of six hundred and forty acres of land. The issue was joined, and at the trial, the defendant relied upon the statute of limitations, and prayed certain instructions of the court to the jury. Instructions were given, as stated in the following bill of exceptions.   In the trial, the plaintiff, introduced in evidence a' grant from the state of North Carolina, dated , to Willoughby 'Williams, for the land in controversy, and deduced a r'eg lar chain of conveyances to plaintiff s lessor, and pro.ved defendant in possession of the land in question at the time suit was brought  defendant introduced a deed from Andrew Jackson to Edward Dillon, and proved that the defendant held by a lease from Dillon  and also in support of Dillon s title, intro* duced evidence tending to prove that persons claiming under and for Dillon, had been more than seven years in possession of the premises in dispute, adverse to the plaintiffs: upon which the court charged the jury, that according to the present state of decision in the Supreme Court of the United States, they could not charge that defendant s title was made good by the statute of limitations.  The decision of the point raised by the bill of exceptions in this case, is one of great importance  both as it respects the amount of property which may be affected by it, and the principle which it involves. In the case of Patton s Lessee v. Easton, which was brought to this court by writ of error in 1816, the same question, which was raised by the bill of exceptions, was then decid d.But it is contended, that under the peculiar circumstances of the case now before the court, they ought not to feel themselves bound by their former decision. This court, in the case of Powell s Lessee v. Green, 2 Peters, 240, gave another decision, under the authority of the one just named  but the question was not argued before the court. The question involves, in the first place, the construction of the-statutes of limitations passed in 1715 and in 1797. The former was adopted by the state  of Tennessee, from North Carolina  the third section of which proyides,M that no person or persons, or their heirs, which hereafter shall have any right or title to any lands, tenements or hereditaments, shall thereunto enter or make claim, but within seven years after his, her or their right or title shall descend or accrue  and in default thereof, such person or persons, so not entering or making default, shall be utterly excluded and disabled from any entry or claim thereafter to be made.   The fourth section provides, after enumerating certain disabilities, and the time within which suit must be brought, after they shall cease, that   all possessions held without suing such claim as aforesaid, shall be a perpetual bar against all, and all manner of persons whatever, that the expectation of heirs may not, in a short time, leave much land unpossessed, and titles so perplexed that no man will know from whom to take or buy land.  In the year 1797, the legislature, in order to settle the  true construction of the existing laws respecting seven years  possession,  enact   that in all cases, wherever any person or persons shall have had seven years  peaceable possession of any land, by virtue of a grant or deed of conveyance founded upon a grant, and ,no legal claim by suit in law, by such, set up to said land, within the above term, that then, and in that case, the person or persons so holding possession as aforesaid, shall be entitled to hold possession in preference to all other claimants  such quantity of land as shall be specified in his, her or their said grant or deed of conveyance, iounded on a grant as aforesaid.  This act further provides, that those who neglect, for the term of seven years, to assert their claim, shall be barred. This court, in the conclusion of their opinion in the case of Patton s Lessee v. Easton, say,   this question, too, has at length, been decided in the supreme court of the state. Subsequent to the division of opinion on this question in the circuit court, two cases have been decided in the supreme court for the state of Tennessee, which have settled the construction of the act of 1797. It has beemdecided, that a possession of seven years is a .bar only when, held  under a grant, or a deed founded on a grant.  The deed must be connected with the grant. This court concurs in that opinion, A deed cannot be  founded on a grant,  which gives a title not derived' in law or equity from that grant, and the words, founded bn a- grant, are foo important to be discarded.  The two decided cases to which reference is made above, are Lillard v. Elliot, and Douglass v. Bledsoe s Heirs. These cases were decided in the year 1815  and this court considered, that they settled the construction of the statute of. 1797. But it is now made to appear that these decisions-were made under such circumstances, that they were never considered, in the state of Tennessee, as fully settling the construction of the act. In the case of Lillard v. Elliot, it seems but two judges concurred on the point, the court being composed of four  and in the case of Weatherhead v. Douglass, there was great contrariety of opinion among the judges, on the point of either legal or equitable connexion. The question was frequently raised before the supreme court of Tennessee  but the construction of the two statutes , of limitations was neyer considered as finally settled until 1825, when the case of Gray and Reeder v. Darby s Lessee was decided. In this cause, an elaborate review of the cases which, had arisen under the statute, is taken, and the construction of both statutes was given, that it is not necessary, to entitle an individual to the.benefits of the'statutes, that he should show a connected title, either legal or equitable. That .if he prove an adverse possession of seven years under a deed, bfefore suit is brought, and show that the land has been granted, he brings himself within the statutes. Since this decision the Jaw has been considered as settled in Tennessee, and there has been so general an acquiescence in all the courts of the state, that the point is not now raised or discussed. This construction has become a rule of property in the state, and numerous suits involving title have been settled by it. Had this been the settled construction of thes  statutes when the decision was made by this court, in the case of Patton s Lessee v. Easton, there can be ho doubt, that that opinion would have conformed to it. But the question is now raised, whether this court will adhere.to its own decision, made under the circumstances stated, or yield to that .of the judicial tribunals of Tennessee. This point has never before been directly decided by this court, on a question of general importance. The cases are numerous where the court have adopted the constructions given to.the. statute of a state by its supreme,judicial tribunal  but it has never been decided, that this court will overrule their own adjudication, establishing an important rule of property, where it has been founded on the construction of a statute made in conformity to the decisions of the state at the time, so as to conform to a different construction adopted after-wards by the.state. This is a question of grave import, and should be approached with great deliberation: It is deeply interesting, in every point of view in which it may be considered. As a rule of property, it is important  and equally so, as it regards the system under which the powers of this tribunal are exercised. It may be proper to examine in wrhat light the decisions of the state courts, in giving a construction to their own statutes, have been considered by this court. In the case of M Keen v. Delaney s Lessee, reported in 5 Cranch, 22, this,court held, that the acknowledgement of a deed before a justice of the supreme court, under a statute which required the acknowledgement to be made before a justice of the peace, havings be n long practised in Pennsylvania, and sanctioned by her tribunals, must be considered as within the statute. The chief justice, in giving the opinion of the court in the case of Bodley v. Taylor, 5 Cranch, 221, says, in reference to the'jurisdiction of a court of equity,  had this been a case of the first impression, some contrariety of opinion would, perhaps, have existed on this point. But it has been sufficiently shown, that the practice of resorting to a court of chancery in oi'der to set up an equitable against the legal title, received in rts origin the sanction of the eourt of appeals, while Kentucky remained a part of Virginia, and.has been so confirmed by an uninterrupted series of decisions, as to be. incorporated into their system, and to be taken into view in the consideration of every title to lands in that country. Such a principle cannot now be shaken.  In the case of Taylor v. Brown, 5 Cranch, 255, the court say, in ref rence to their decision in the case of Bodley v. Taylor,   this opinion is still thought perfectly correct in itself. Its application to particular cases, and indeed its being considered as a rule of decision on Kentucky titles, will depend very much on the decisions of that country: For, in questions respecting title to real estate, especially, the'same rule ought certainly to prevail in both courts.  This court, in laying down the requisites of a valid entry, in the case of Massie v. Watts, 6 Cranch, 165, say,   these principles have been laid down by the eourts, and must be considered as expositions of the statuie. A great proportion of the landed property of the country depends on adhering to them.  In 9 Cranch, 87, the court say, that  in cases depending on the statute of a state, and more especially in those respecting titles to lands, the federal courts adopt the construction of the state, where that construction is settled and can be ascertained. And in 5 Wheaton, 279, it is stated, that   the supreme court uniformly acts under a desire to conform its decisions to those of the state courts, on their local laws.  The supreme court holds in the highest respect decisions of state courts upon local laws forming rules of property, 2 Wheaton, 316. In construing local statutes respecting real property, the courts of the union are governed by the decisions of-the state tribunals, 6 Wheaton, 119. The court say, in the case of Elmandorf v. Taylor et al. 10 Wheaton, 152,  that the courts of the United States, in cases depending on the laws of a particular state, will, in general, adopt the construction which the courts.of the state have given to those laws.    This,course is founded upon the principle, supposed to be universally recognised, that the judicial department of every government, where, such department exists, is the appropriate organ for construing the legislative  acts of that government.  In 7 Wheat. 361, the court again declare, that   the statute laws of the states must furnish.the rule of decision to the federal courts, as far as they comport with the constitution of the United States, in all cases arising within the respective stales  and a fixed and received construction of their respective statute laws, in their own courts, makes a part of such statute law.  The court again say in 12 Wheaton, 153,  that this court adopts the local law of real property as ascertained by the decisions of the state courts, whether these decisions are grounded on the construction of the statutes of the state, or form a part of the unwritten law of the state, which has become a fixed ruF of property.   Quotations might be multiplied, but the aboye will show that this court have uniformly adopted th  decisions of the state tribunals, respectively, in the construction of their statutes. That this has been done as a matter of principle, 'in all cases where the decision of a state court has become a rule, of property. In a great majority of the causes brought before the federal tribunals, they are called to enforce the laws of the states. The rights of parties are determined under those laws, and it would b  a strange perversion of principle, if the judicial exposition of those laws, by the state tribunals, Should be disregarded. These expositions constituid the law, and fix the rule of property! Rights are acquired under, this rule, and it regulates all the transactions which come within its scope. It is admitted in the argument, that this court, in giving a construction to a local law, will be influenced by the decisions of the local tribunals': but, it is eontertded, that when such a construction shall be given in Conformity top those decisions, it must be considered finaL That if the state shall change the rule, it does not comport either with , the consistency or dignity of this tribunal to adopt the change. Such a course, it is insisted, would recognise in the state courts a.power to revise the decisions of this court, and -fix the rule of property differently.from its solemn adjudications. That-the federal court when sitting within' a slate, is the court of that state, being so constituted by the constitution and laws of the union  and as such, has an equal right, with the state courts to fix the construction of the local law. On,'all questions arising under the constitution and. laws of the union, this oourt may- exercise a revising power - ai d its decisions are final, and obligatory on all-other judicial tribunals, state as well as federal. A state tribunal has a right to examine any' such questions and .to determine them, but its' decision must conform - to that of the supreme court,-or the corrective power may be exercised. But the case is very different where a question arises under a local law. The decision of this question, by the highest judicial tribunal of a state, should be*considered as final by this court  not because the state tribunal, in such a case, has any power to bind this court  but because, in the language of the court, in the case of Shelby et al. v. Gray, 11 Wheat. 361,  a fixed and received construction by a state in its own courts, mates a part of the statute law. . The. same reason which influences this court to adopt the construction given to the local'law, in the first instance, is not less strong in favour of following-it in the second, if the state tribunals should change the construction.' A reference is here made not to. a single adjudication, but to a series of decisions Which shall settle the rule. Are not the injurious effects Oft the interests of the citizens of a state, as great, in refusing to adopt the change of construction, as in refusing to adopt the first construction. A refusal in the one case as well as in the other, has the effect to establish, in the state, two rules of property. Would not a change in the construction of a law of the United States, by this tribunal, be obligatory on the state courts? The statute, as last expounded, would be the law of the union  and why may not the same effect be given to' the-last exposition, of a local law by the state court? The exposition forms a part of the local law, and is binding on all the people of the state, and its inferior judicial tribunals. It is emphatically the law.of the state  which the federal court, while sitting within, the state, and this court, when a case is brought before them, are called to.enforce. If the rule as settled should prove inconvenient or injurious to.the public interests, the legislature of the state may modify the law or repeal it. If the construction of the highest* judicial tribunal of a state form a part of its statute law, as much as an enactment by the legislature, how can this court make a distinction between them? There could be no hesitation in so. modifying our decisions .as to conform to any legislative alteration in a statute  and why should not the same rule apply, where the judicial branch of the state government, in the exercise of its acknowledged functions, should, by construction, give a different effect to a statute, from what had at first been given to it. The charge of inconsistency might be made with more force and propriety against the federal tribunals for a disregard of this rule, than by conforming to it. They profess to be bound by the loeal law  arid yet they reject the exposition of that law, which forms a part of it. It is no answer to this objection, that a different exposition was formerly given to the  ict which was adopted by the federal court.. The inquiry is, what is the settled law of the state at the time the decision is made. This constitutes the rule of property within the state, by which the rights of litigant parties must be determined. As the federal tribunals profess to be governed by this rule, they can never. act inconsistently by enforcing it. If they change their decision^ it is. because the rule on which that decision was founded has been changed. The case under consideration illustrates the propriety and necessity of this' rule. It is now the settled'law of Tennessee, that an adverse possession   of seven years under a deed for land that has been granted, will give a valid title. . But, .by. the decision of this court, such-a possession, under such evidence'of right, will not give a valid title. In addition to the. above requisites, this'court have .'decided that the tenant' must connect his deed with a grant.  It therefore follows, that the occupant whose title is protected under, the statutes, before a state tribunal, is unprotected by them, before the federal court. The plaintiff in ejectment, after being defeated in his action before a state court, on the above construction, to insure success has only to bring an action in the federal court. This may be easily done by a change of his residence, or a bona fide conveyance of the land. Here is   judicial conflict, arising from two rules of property in the same state, and the consequences are riot only deeply injurious to the citizens'of the-state, but calculated to engender th.e most lasting discontents. It is therefore essential to the interests of .the country, and to' the harmony of the judicial action of the federal and state governments, that there should be but one rule of property in' a state. In several of: the states, the English statute of limitations has been adopted, with' various modifications  but in the saving clause, the expression  beyond the seas,  is retained. These words in some of the states are construed to mean   out of the state,  aBd in others a literal construction has been given to them. In the case of Murray s Lessee v. Baker et al. 3 Wheaton, 540, this court decided, that the expressions    beyond seas,  and  out of the state,  are analogous  and are to have the same construction. But, suppose the. same question should be brought before this court from a state where the construction of the. same words had been long settled to mean literally beyond seas, would not this court conform to it? And might. not the same arguments be used in such, a case, as are now urged against conforming to the local construction of the law'  of Tennessee. Apparent inconsistencies in the construction of the statute laws of the states, may be expected to. arise, from the organization of our judicial systems  but an adherence by the federal courts to the exposition of the local law  as given by the courts of the state, will greatly tend to preserve harmony in the exercise of the judicial power, in the state and federal tribunals. This rule is not only recommended by strong considerations of propriety, growing out of our system of jurisprudence, but it.is sustained by principle and authority. As it appears to this court, that the construction of the statutes of limitations is now well settled, differently from what was supposed to be the rule at the time this* court decided the case of Patton s Lessee v. Easton, and the case of Powell s Lessee v. Green  and as the instructions of the circuit court were governed by these decisions, and not by the settled law of the state  the judgment must be reversed, and the cause remanded for further proceedings. Mr Justice Baldwin dissented. This cause came on to be heard on the transcript of the record, from the circuit court of the United States for the district of West Tennessee, and was argued by counsel. On consideration whereof, it is ordered and adjudged by this Court, that the judgment of the said circuit court in this cause be, and the same is hereby remanded to the said circuit court, with directions to award a venire facias de noyo. attorneys:  Mr Grundy.for the plaintiff in error  Mr Isaacks for the defendant. corrections:  head_matter: Asa Green, Plaintiff in Error v. The Lessee of Henry Neal, Defendant in Error. The case of Patton s Lessee v. Easton, 1 Wheat. 276, and Powell s Lessee v. Green, 2 Peters, 240, as to the statutes oflimitations of Tennessee, overruled. In the case of Patton s Lessee v. Easton, this court, after examining the provisions of the statute of limitations of Tennessee in reference to a peaceable possession of land for seven years by virtue of a grant, or deed of conveyance founded upon a grant, and no legal claim by suit set up to the lands, say,   this question, too, has at length been decided in the supreme court for the state of Tennessee, which have settled the construction of the act of 1787. It has been decided that a possession of seven years is a'bar only when held   under a grant, or a deed founded on a grant.    The deed must be connected with the grant. This court concurs in that opinion.  The two cases to which the court referred were decided in 1805, and the court considered that they settled the construction of the act of 1797. But it is now made to appear that these decisions were made under such circumstances, that they were never considered in the state of Tennessee as fully settling the construction of the act. The question was frequently raised before the supreme court of Tennessee, but the construction of the two statutes of limitations was never considered as finally settled until 1828, when the case of Gray and Reeder v. Darby s Lessee was decided. In that case it has been adjudged that it is not necessary, to entitle an individual to the benefit of the statutes, that he should show a connected title, either legal or equitable. That if he prove an adverse possession, under a deed, of seven years before suit is brought, and show that the land, has been granted, he brings himself within the statutes. Since this decision, the law has been considered settled in Tennessee, and there has been so general an acquiescence in all the courts of the state, that the point is not now raised oi discussed. As it appears to this court, that the construction of the statutes of limitations of Tennessee is now well settled, different from what was supposed to be the rule at the time this court decided the case of Patton s Lessee v. Easton, and the case of Powell s Lessee v. Green  and as the instructions of the circuit court of Tennessee were governed by these decisions, and not by the settled law of the state  the judgment must he reversed, and the . cause remanded for further proceedings. This court have uniformly adopted the decisions of the state tribunals, respectively, in the construction of their statutes. This has been done as a matter of principle  in all cases where the decision of a state court has become a rule of property. In a great majority of the causes brought before the federal tribunals, they are called on to enforce the laws of the states. The rights of parties are determined under these laws, and it would be a strange perversion of principle if the judicial exposition of these laws by the state tribunals, should be disregarded. These expositions constitute the law, and fix the rule of property. Rights are acquired under this rule  and it regulates all the transactions which come within its scope. On all questions arising under the constitution and laws of the union, this court may exercise a revising power  and its decisions are final add obligatory on all other judicial tribunals, state as well as federal. A statj tribunal ha^a right to examine any such questions, and to determine thereon  but its decision must conform to that of the Supreme Court, or the corrective power may be exercised. But the case is very different when the question arises under a local law. The decision of this question by the highest tribunal of a state, should be considered as final by this court  not because the state tribunal in such a case has any power to bind this court  but because, in the language of the court in the case of Shelby et al. v. Guy, 11 Wheat. 361,   a fixed and received construction by a state in its own courts, makes a part of the statute law.  If the construction of the highest judicial tribunal of a state forms a part of the statute law, as much as an enactment by the legislature, how can this court  make a distinction between them? There could be no hesitation in so modifying our. decisions as to conform to any legislative alteration in a statute  and why should not the same rule apply where the judicial branch of the state government, in the exercise of its acknowledged functions, should, by construction, give a different effect to a statute from what bad at first been given to it.

      "Choice 9:\n",
      "judges:   parties:  DUNLAP et al. v. STETSON. opinions:  STORY, Circuit Justice. I do not think it necessary to go over the pleadings at large in this case, but shall content myself with an exposition of those facts only, which bear upon the main points suggested at the argument The first point raised is, whether the suit itself can be maintained, the defendant being a citizen of Massachusetts, and not resident in Maine, and the subpoena having been served upon him in the state of Massachusetts. The exception has been taken by way of plea to the jurisdiction, and has also been relied on in the answer, and must of course now be disposed of, before we can enter upon the merits. The judiciary act of 1789, c. 20, g 11, has declared,  that no civil suit shall be brought before either of the said courts (of the United States) against an inhabitant of the United States, by any original process, in any other district than that whereof he is an inhabitant, or in which he shall be found at the time of serving the writ.  This has always been deemed a personal privilege of the party defendant, introduced for his benefit, and which he is at liberty to waive, aud not, strictly speaking, a question of the jurisdiction of the court. But the defendant has chosen, on this occasion, to take the objection in due season  and the question is, whether the present suit is such an original process as is contemplated by the act. I believe, the general, if not the universal, practice has been, to consider bills of injunction upon judgments in the circuit courts of the United States, not as original, but as auxiliary and dependent suits, and properly sustainable in that court which gave the original judgment, and has it completely under its control. The court itself possesses a power over its own judgments by staying execution thereon  and it would be very inconvenient if it did not possess the means of rendering such further redress, as equity and good conscience required. Although a circuit court in another district might act in personam upon the party, and so far grant an equitable relief, the suit could not be effectual to bind the circuit court in which the judgment was rendered. And it is easy to perceive, that many .embarrassments, as well to 1lu> remedy, as to the title under the judgment, might :ar.ise .from this conflict and separation of jurisdictions. And if the party obtaining the judgment should, in the mean time, become a citizen of the same state, as the other party, there would, in many cases, be an entire failure of all equitable relief, contrary to the plainest principles of justice. Considerations of this sort have, as I am informed, satisfied the minds of some of the most enlightened judges, that the act of congress never was intended to apply to bills for relief upon judgments rendered in the circuit courts. They are deemed to be, not original suits, but branches' growing out of the original suits, and dependent upon them, and very much in their nature, like those hearings in equity authorized by our laws, in cases of the confession of forfeiture upon the penalties of bonds, mortgages, and other agreements, with collateral conditions. There has always appeared to me to be great weight in this reasoning  and I should not hesitate to follow it, unless some stubborn authority stood in my way. X know of no such authority. On the contrary, the case of Logan v. Patrick, 5 Cranch. [9 U. S.] 288, if it did not decide the very point, has never been construed, as questioning it. The form of the certificate in the cause was (apparently in answer to the first question put),  that the said circuit court can entertain jurisdiction of the cause.  A second point is, that the present suit is not maintainable, because, since the rendition of the judgment, and before the filing of the bill, the plaintiffs sold and released to one Richard Pike all their right and title to the land in controversy. In fact, the land was originally purchased of Pike by the ancestor of the plaintiffs, from whom they derived their title, under a deed of general warranty. The argument is, that Pike is now the real plaintiff in interest, and being a citizen of Massachusetts, he could not now maintain any bill in equity in the circuit court against the defendant, who is a citizen of the same state. If this be so, there is an extinguishment of all remedy in equity, in respect both to Pike and the present plaintiffs upon the judgment, for there is no state court of chancery, to which the parties can aj>ply. There is another difficulty not adverted to at the argument, and that is founded on the 11th section of the judiciary act of 1789, ch. 20, which provides, that no district or circuit court shall have  cognizance of any suit to recover the contents of any promissory note or other chose in action in favour  of an assignee, unless such suit might have been prosecuted in such court to recover the  said contents, if no assignment had been made, except in cases of foreign bills of exchange.  Now, upon the ground assumed by the defendant, the present plaintiffs could not maintain an injunction bill in this district to this judgment  and supposing the conveyance to Tike to operate as an assignment of their rights, the latter also would be precluded from the same resort. These are inconveniences, which cannot escape the-most superficial observation. They furnish no reason for assuming jurisdiction, where-it is not given  but they furnish some reason against the extension of general words to-cases, which, it is not easy to believe, could have been within the legislative intention. But it is not necessary to rest this question on any considerations of this nature. The-judgment in the writ of entry was a conclusive bar to the title of the plaintiffs, so far as. it was of a legal nature. It was a complete recognition of the defendant s right of recovery, and an extinguishment pro tanto of the plaintiffs  title. It was not necessary to-perfect the title of the defendant, that he should have been put into possession of the land by a writ of seisin. He might enter into-possession without any such execution, for his title was complete by the judgment. So-are the authorities recognized by our own courts. This being so, there is no pretence-to say, that the deed to Pike did or could convey any legal estate to him against the defendant. It was as little competent to pass any equitable estate in the premises  for in a correct sense the plaintiffs had no such estate. If the plaintiffs are entitled to any redress upon the present bill (and the circumstances therein stated constitute their whole equity), it is most obvious, that it is not because they possess any equitable estate in the land, but because they possess an equitable claim upon the defendant, personally, for relief. This is not the case of an express or implied trust, created or admitted by the parties themselves. It is a naked equity, which is set up upon the ground of a constructive trust created by a court of chancery, because there has been some mistake, or fraud, or accident, or other claim, acting upon the conscience of the party. Until the equity has been established by the decree of a court of equity, it has no positive existence. It is the creature of the court itself. Now, admitting that choses in action, and even possibilities of interest, are in general assignable in equity, it would be difficult to establish, that such a mere naked possibility of equity, as this, is assignable, or would be recognized and enforced in a court of equity in a suit by the assignee. The cases of Jacobson v. Williams, 1 P. Wms. 383, 385, and Spragg v. Binkes, 5 Ves. 583, admonish us, that courts of equity entertain some reserves on this subject  and without a positive authority in its favor, I should feel no inclination to sustain it. Nothing approaching to such an authority can, as far as my researches extend, be found. I cannot perceive how the as-signee of such a constructive trust, or naked equity, as is here set up, could sustain a bill to enjoin the judgment. And if he could, it would not necessarily follow, that it might not also be maintainable in the name of the plaintiffs for the benefit of the assignee. But the deed to Pike contains no such assignment. It is a mere conveyance and release of all the  right, title, and interest (of the plaintiffs) in and to the lots of land,  &c. free from the claims of all persons, claiming by, through, or under them. Now, this naked equity constitutes no right, title, or interest in the land itself. A judgment creditor has a lien on the land of his debtor  but it is neither jus in re, nor jus ad rem  and though he releases all his right to the land, he may afterwards extend his execution upon it. So a release of a right to land does not extinguish a bare authority in an executor to sell it. Both of these cases are much stronger than the present  and to carry the interpretation of the words of the deed to the extent of operating as an assignment of the possible equity of the plaintiff, would be, not to enforce, but to defeat the intention of the parties to it. It would be a much more rational interpretation to construe it (as is contended for by the plaintiff s counsel), as intended to operate as a release or extinguishment of the covenants of warranty of Pike, in his original conveyance to their ancestor. For these reasons, I am of opinion, that this objection is -unsustainable. There is another objection to the bill, which may as well be disposed of in connexion with the preceding. It is, that if the defendant is entitled to any part of the land, the judgment cannot be enjoined  for relief in equity will be granted only, when the fraud goes to the whole of the judgment, and not where it is but of partial application. This objection is founded upon a mistake of the real intent of the authorities, which have been relied on to support it. A court of equity will grant relief to the extent of the injury, which the party seeking the injunction had suffered. If that applies only to part of the land recovered, there is nothing in the principles or practice of the court, which prohibits it from restraining or modifying its relief accordingly. We may now approach the merits of the case. Both parties claim title under one .Tames Budge, who became entitled, in the manner which will be hereafter stated, to one hundred acres of land in Bangor, of which he sold one acre to one William Mc-Glathry by a deed dated in April, 1798, describing the same by certain metes and bounds. The remaining ninety-nine acres confessedly belong to the defendant, and Messrs. Lapish and French, in undivided moieties, through intermediate conveyances from Budge. The whole contest between the parties respects the title to this one acre. It is bounded and described, in the deed from Budge to McGlathry thus:  A certain lot of land, lying and being in Bangor, on Con-deskeig point, so called, bounded and described as follows, to wit, beginning at a stake on the west bank of Penobscot river, near a thorn bush marked on four sides, running north eleven rods to a stake and stones  thence southerly to a stake and stones, a corner  thence south nine rods to a stake and stones on the same bank of the same river  thence running on the western bank of said river to high-water mark sixteen rods, to the first mentioned bounds, with all the privileges of water and landing to the same belonging.  The colonial act of 1641 declares,  that in all creeks, coves, and other places, about and upon salt water, the proprietor of the land adjoining shall have propriety to the low-water mark, where the sea doth not ebb above one hundred rods, and not more, wheresoever it ebbs further.  The question is, whether by the terms of the present deed, McGlathry as riparian proprietor took the flats to low-water mark, in front of the land, or whether, as against Budge, and all claiming under him, he is limited to high-water mark on the western bank of Penobscot river. It appears to me very clear, that the deed bounds McGlathry by the western bank of the river at the high-water mark. Assuming Budge to have been an original riparian proprietor, entitled, by the operation of law, to the adjacent flats, it was certainly competent for him to sell the upland and reserve the flats. The only question is, what is the true construction of his deed in this particular. It is to be observed, that it is not a deed bounding the grantee on the river, or the stream of the river, generally, where the flats might pass by implication  but the boundaries are specific and definite. The land conveyed is marked out, by certain stakes and stones, on the west bank of the river  the beginning point is on the same bank near a thorn-bush  and the line along the river runs on the west bank of the river to high-water mark to the first bound. The limitation throughout is by the bank of the river, and with reference to known objects on that bank  and the words,  to high-water mark.  can have no other rational meaning, in the con-nexion in which they stand, than as indicating the front line of the bank itself. The subsequent words,  with all the privileges of water and landing to the same belonging,  do not extend the bounds of the land conveyed  but merely secure to it the easements and privileges of water and landing, which may well consist with a reserve of the flats to the grantor. Such, upon principle, is the construction of the deed, to which my mind is irresistibly led. And the authorities are equally conclusive in its favour. It is only necessary to refer to Storer v. Freeman, 6 Mass. 435  Hatch v. Dwight, 17 Mass. 289  and Hasty v. Johnson, 3 Greenl. 282. Then, it is suggested, that since the period of the grant,' there has been an encroachment upon the bank, by the gradual wear of the stream of the river. If this be so, the grantees under McGlathry must be confined to the line of the bank as it now actually exists. It is like the common case of al-luvion, where something is gradually added to land by an imperceptible increase. What is taken from the bank is an imperceptible increment to the flats, and passes to the  owner of it, in the same manner, as if there had been a like increment to the bank, it would have passed to the riparian proprietor. He takes the title, subject to those common incidents, which may diminish or increase the extent of his boundaries. This is common learning, laid down in Mr. Justice Blackstone s Commentaries (2 Comm. 261), and has been fully recognized in Adams v. Frothingham, 3 Mass. 363, and very recently acted upon by the king s bench in a  case strikingly in point (Stratton v. Brown, 4 Barn. & C. 485). The plaintiffs then must  be deemed to be limited in their title to the bank of the river, as it now exists, and have no legal or equitable title to any portion of the front, which now constitutes flats. But the principal inquiry yet remains to be considered  and that is, whether the plaintiffs have made out any ground whatsoever for equitable relief, so as to entitle them to a decree of the court To understand the nature of the objections urged against them, it will be necessary to state  some of the leading facts, asserted in the pleadings, and established in the proofs. Budge was a settler on the one hundred acres of land before the first day of January, 1784, and continued in possession, until he made conveyances to the parties respectively. The land, however, belonged to the commonwealth of Massachusetts, and consequently, Budge had no legal title to maintain his possession against the government. On the 5th of March, 1801, the legislature of Massachusetts passed a resolve, on the petition of the inhabitants of Bangor, praying for a confirmation of the respective lots, on which they had settled before the 17th of February, 1798. It provided,  th t all the settlers in the town of Bangor, or their legal representatives, who actually settled before 1st of January, 1784, be entitled to a deed of their respective lots of one hundred acres each, by paying into the treasury of this commonwealth eight dollars and forty-five cents,  &c. It further provided,  that the committee for the sale of eastern lands be, and they hereby are directed to cause the  several lots in the town of Bangor to be surveyed and run out by metes and bounds  to each of the' settlers in said town, agreeably   to this resolve, by some faithful surveyor, &c. and a return thereof to be made to said committee by the first day of November next  and that six months be allowed to each settler, after the return of the surveyor, to pay for their lands, the settlers paying interest, from this date, upon the money for their respective lots.  Long before this period, to wit, in 1787, and while he was in possession of his lot, Budge mortgaged the same jointly to Robert Treat and James Ginn. He afterwards, in April, 1794, mortgaged the same to one John Lee, who obtained a judgment for possession of the same in September, 1798, on which execution was issued, and possession taken in January, 1799. In March, 1799, Budge conveyed the same lot to Peck, with the following reserve,  excepting one acre sold to William McGlathry, as by his deed, dated the 19th of April, 1798,  and also subject to the mortgage to Lee. Peck, on the same day, as collateral security for the fulfilment of the terms of the sale, re-mortgaged the lot back to Budge. A few days afterwards, Peck sold and released the same lot with the same exception of Mc-Glathry s acre, to one Daniel Wild. In November, 1800, Wild conveyed one moiety of the same lot to Zadock French and Robert Lapish  and in March, 1801, he conveyed the other moiety to the defendant Each of these deeds also contains the like exception of the one acre of McGlathry. Budge released to Peck the mortgage given to him by the latter, in February, 1801, and in June, of the same year, Ginn released to Budge his right in the mortgage to him and Treat  and afterwards Treat released his share of the mortgage to Peck, and confirmed it in October, 1803. In June, 1801, Lee assigned his mortgage and judgment thereon to Robert Lapish  and in October of the same year, Lapish released to Budge all actions, causes of action, and demands, on account of that mortgage, with a proviso which will be hereafter noticed. In November, 1801, the surveyor, appointed by the commissioners, made a return, that he had  laid out by metes and bounds, conformably to the resolve, to Robert Lapish and others, assignees of James Budge, one hundred acres of land,  and proceeded to state the boundaries. In March, 1802, the commissioners made a conveyance, according to law, to Robert Lapish, Amasa Stetson, and Zadock French,  assignees of James Budge, who settled in said town of Bangor, before the 1st of January. 1784, . of all the right, title, and interest of the commonwealth in and to the same lot of land. Such is the de-raignment of the title of the defendant to the moiety of the lot It is most manifest, that the deed of the commissioners, in 1802, conveyed to the grantees the whole lot, supposing them to be the assignees of Budge' of the whole one hundred acres. It is as manifest, that they never were assignees of the one acre conveyed by Budge to Mc-Glathry, and that the very deeds, under which they claim, all contain an express exception of that acre, so that they had the most perfect and complete notice, not only, that they had themselves no title to it, hut who the party was, that did possess the title. Under such circumstances, it is natural to inquire, upon what .ground the defendant can assert any claim whatsoever, in justice or equity, to the acre of McGlathry. He never become the purchaser of it  it never was assigned to him by Wild  he had full notice of the existence of the title of McGlathry  and his own title to the ninety-nine acres is precisely of the same nature under Budge, as that of the plaintiffs to the one acre. He has, however, with Lapish and French, procured the legal title to the whole lot from the  commonwealth, and he has, at law, recovered his moiety of this acre, under that title, against the plaintiffs, who are in possession under the original title of McGlathry. He now contends, that he has a right to hold it  discharged of all the equity of the plaintiffs  and that their claim, whatever it was, is utterly extinguished. I was curious to ascertain, how this was to be made out, as a matter of general justice, and listened at the argument for some explanation of the merits  of such an assertion of right None was offered  and therefore it stands drily upon the naked point of superiority of legal title  and it must, if maintainable at all, prevail on this account and on no other. Let us then proceed to the consideration of the objections raised to defeat the relief, under this aspect  of the case. The defendant and Lapish and French have, it is true, obtained from the commonwealth the legal title to the whole lot. And much was suggested at the argument, of the  sacredness of titles derived from the commonwealth, and of the danger of disturbing them. This court is not insensible of the value of such titles  and has never felt the  slightest inclination to bring them into jeopardy. This suit involves no consideration of that sort. The question here is not, whether the commonwealth had, or did convey, a title, perfect at law, but whether that title has gone to the proper object of its bounty. Would it be pretended, that if a man should fraudulently procure from the commonwealth a title to lands, intended for another,  either by its bounty or its conn-act, by misrepresenting himself to be that person, or his as-signee, that he should possess the land, thus procured by his fraud or misrepresentation, free of all claims of the injured party? That because his deception had been complete, therefore it should constitute and perpetuate an unimpeachable title? A court of law would not hesitate to set aside such a conveyance. No conveyance is so sacred, that, if infected by fraud, it may not be overturned. And in a court of equity, whose very institution is to enforce good faith and honest dealing, it would not admit of a moment s doubt, that the court would betray its duty, if it did not repudiate such a transaction  if it did not look behind the form, and arrive at the substance. I do not mean to insinuate, that the present is such a case. I am very far from thinking so  and I should be sorry indeed to be obliged to decree relief against the defendant upon such an obnoxious ground. But how was the title obtained from the commonwealth for the whole lot? It was upon the express suggestion, that the defendant and his co-grantees were the assignees of Budge of the whole title. So the surveyor s return states it  so also the deed to them of the commissioners. It is a conveyance to them as assignees of Budge, and in no other character. Budge was the original object of the bounty of the commonwealth, as a settler in Bangor  and by the resolve of 1801, he and his representatives only, were entitled to the bounty of the 100 acre lot. The commissioners had no right to convey to the defendant and Lapish and French, but as the representatives of Budge in the character of assignees. If they conveyed the whole lot to them, it was because it was understood, that they were the assignees of the whole. It was of no consequence, whether McGlathry was a settler or not, any more than whether the defendant was a settler or not The title turned solely upon Budge s being a settler, and upon the validity and sufficiency of the assignment of his right to others. How, then, has it happened, that the conveyance of the commissioners has, against the express legislative intention, as to this one acre, been made, not to Budge, or his assignee, but to persons, who now are admitted never to have been assignees, and who had full knowledge of the fact of their total want of title, at the very time of the conveyance? It must be either, because there has been some fraud or mistake, or an implied trust for the real assignee. In either case, the power of a court of equity to administer relief is, in my judgment, incontrovertible. These are the very classes of cases, in which its jurisdiction is ordinarily, and most beneficially exercised. I have already said, that, in my judgment, fraud ought not, in this transaction, to be imputed to the defendant and his co-grantees. It would, in any case, be a harsh supposition, where the circumstances did not necessarily lead to it. The whole of this transaction is perfectly explicable upon other grounds. The defendant and Lapish and French were the real owners of ninety-nine out of the one hundred acres, and legally represented it. The commissioners, either by mistake supposed them assignees of the whole, or, knowing the facts, and willing to execute the authority confided to them by the legislature, conveyed the whole to them with an implied trust, that they would convey to McGlathry his share, or extinguish his right. The grantees could have no objection to such a course  for they could not insist upon separate titles to their portions of the land, and might be delayed, by the outstanding title of McGlathry, from receiving their deed. When they received the conveyance from the commissioners they must have known the mistake, if it was one  or they must have taken the conveyance upon the implied trust, that they would hold the one acre for McGlathry's benefit. In no other way can their conduct be reconcilable with good faith  for if they represented themselves as the sole owners  or, knowing the mistake of the commissioners, if they took the deed, intending to defraud McGlathry, the transaction, both at law and in equity, would be pronounced void for the fraud, and the deed be set aside on that account, as well against McGlathry and his assignees, as against the commonwealth. Under such circumstances the defence might have been set up in a writ of entry, or other action, touching the realty, as well as in a court of equity  for it would go to the validity of the whole conveyance. It would prove it bad in its origin. But the view, which is taken by myself, of this part of the cause, is, that it presents, not a case of fraud, but a clear case of mistake, or of implied trust  and either way it is within the acknowledged jurisdiction of a court of equity. It is further objected, that the bill is brought more than twenty years after the deed was given by the commissioners, and that it is now, ujxm general principles, too late to institute such a suit. If there had been an uninterrupted possession by the defendant and his co-grantees, of the land during all this period, there would have been great force in the argument, from lapse of time, against entertaining an original suit But, here, there is no pretence of any such possession. On the contrary, McGlathry and his assignees have had an actual or constructive possession of the land during a considerable portion of this period  and the judgment, against which relief is now sought, was the first disturbance of the plaintiffs  right of possession. While the plaintiffs wore left in possession of the land, they might well repose upon their equitable title  and the injunction now prayed for, is the result of a necessity imposed upon them by the procurement of that judgment The circumstance of there not having been an ouster during all the intermediate period, is not insignificant in expounding the defendant s own opinion of the nature of his own title to the land. It is further objected, that, under the resolve of 1801, no person could be entitled to claim as a settler, or as the representative of a settler, unless the possession was continued down to the time of the passage of that resolve. That this resolve has a tacit reference to the resolve of 28th of June, 17S9, where the legislature has defined, who shall be deemed settlers, entitled to relief on the cases therein provided for  and that by the terms of the latter resolve settlers are to be construed to be such persons only, as, before the 1st of January, 1784, went on some tract or lot of land, for the purpose of clearing and cultivating the same, and making it the place of their settled abode, and actually resided on such lot by themselves, or some person under them, before the said time, and cleared, fit for mowing and tillage, at least one acre of land, and built a dwelling house thereon, and still continue to reside on the   same. Looking to the other provisions of this resolve, and. the provisions of the resolve of 1801, I confess that my own opinion distinctly is, that they have no common object or connexion. The resolve of 1801, gives the bounty to all the settlers in the town of Bangor, or their legal representatives, who. actually settled before the 1st of January, 1784, without annexing any qualifications or limitations, like those inserted in the resolve of 1789. The object was, a special relief to the inhabitants of a particular town, upon their petition  and there is not the slightest reference, in the resolve, to any antecedent resolve. It seems to me a very strained construction to incorporate, by implication, the provisions of the resolve of 1789, into this resolve, when there is no necessary connexion between them, and no reference, which leads the mind from the one to the other. If the case turned upon this consideration, I should feel very great difficulty in adopting such a construction. I am aware, that in Lambert v. Carr, 9 Mass. 185, there is an expression in the opinion of the court, delivered by Mr. Justice Sewall, which lends countenance to it. With all my unaffected respect for that able judge, the dictum seems to me wholly uncalled for by the case, and not to have been sufficiently considered. I agree with that decision, that the legislature did not intend, that any person should take, under the resolve of 1801, except those who were settlers, and whose settlements had not been abandoned, but had been continued down, by themselves or their legal representatives. This appears to me a just ex-j>osition of the language of the resolve of 1801, standing wholly by itself. A settlement, which had been abandoned, and under which no person claimed a continuing, derivative title, could not have been an object of the legislative bounty. The facts of that case distinctly showed, that Smart s settlement had been abandoned many years before. But, whether this point were correctly decided or not, is, in my view of the present case, not material. The question, here, is not, as there, who were original settlers, entitled to the legislative bounty. Neither McGlathry, nor the defendant and his co-grantees could pretend to be such settlers. Their whole claim is derivative from Budge, as an original settler, and any other title would be repugnant to the whole facts of the case. The acts and proceedings of the commissioners are conclusive on this point. They decided, that Budge was an original settler, entitled to the bounty, and incidentally, of course, that his settlement was so preserved as to he deemed a continuing settlement down to the passage of the resolve. If a settlement for any part of the land, it was for the whole lot, for his title was rec-ognised for the whole  and whether that possession was personal, or by his assignees, is wholly immaterial now, because the decision of the commissioners is conclusive, upon the state of his title. The assignees of Budge cannot now gainsay such possession or title  and they are estopped from disputing it. If McGlathry or Lapish had a possession, actual or constructive, of any part,' it enured for the benefit of the whole lot. I can perceive no evidence of abandonment of their claim to the one acre, either by Budge or McGlathry, or his grantees. On the contrary, the possession has been upheld, through all the intermediate grantees, upon this title alone. But it is said, that the decision of the commissioners was conclusive upon all parties. But of what was it conclusive? I agree, that 'they had the sole right to ascertain who were the original set-tlors, entitled to the bounty lots  and to ascertain the boundaries of those lots. Their deeds were conclusive on these points. But I cannot admit, that their authority was con-elusive as to who were the legal representatives of any particular settler. Least of all, can I admit, that they had a right to convey the whole to any persons, who were confessedly the grantees or representatives of a part only. They might be deceived, or they might mistake the state of the facts  but any adjudication of the whole, to persons entitled to but a part, would be an excess of their jurisdiction, and however it might be binding between the commonwealth and the grantees of the lot named in the deed, could not bind the equitable rights of third' persons, as to those grantees. The cases of Lambert v. Carr, 9 Mass. 183, and Harlow v. French, Id. 192, do not impugn this doctrine. There was no question in either of these cases, whether either party was the true representative of an original settler. The rights set up were conflicting rights under adverse settlers. The like answer applies to the case of Bussey v. Luce, 2 Greenl. 367. It would be so manifestly unjust, that any person should derive a title by his own wrong, or by mistake, to the whole land, when he had purchased with an exception of a part, and could pretend no right to that part, that nothing but the clearest authority would lead me to affirm such a principle. I know of no such authority. On the contrary, I consider the doctrine in Wilson v. Mason, 1 Cranch [5 U. S.] 45, 100, strictly applicable.  He who acquires a legal title,  say the court,  having notice of a prior equity of another, becomes a trustee for that other to the extent of his equity.  No man can doubt the equity* of McGlathry and his assignees to the one acre, under the resolve of 1801  and the defendant had the fullest notice of it. There is also another salutary principle in equity, of which Lord Iiodesdale has taken notice in Bateman v. Willoe, 1 SCh. & L. 201, 205, that where a party has possessed himself improperly of something, by means of which he has an unconscientious advantage at law, equity will either put it' out of the way or restrain him from using it Under one aspect of the present case, there might have been difficulty in escaping from the proper application of this jurisdiction. It is further objected, that the plaintiffs are not entitled to relief, because the defendant and Lapish and French are the owners of the legal title to the one acre under the mortgages of Budge to Treat and Ginn in 1787, and Budge to Lee in 1794, which the defendant asserts to be still subsisting mortgages, of which they are the assignees, and he has a right in equity to set them up against the plaintiffs. Now, it is perfectly clear, that, as the conveyance by Budge to McGlathry of this one acre was with covenants against incumbrances and of general warranty, McGlathry or his grantees are entitled to be relieved, as against Budge, from both of these mortgages. When Budge conveyed the one hundred acre lot in March, 1799, to Peck, it was with an express exception of the acre conveyed to McGlathry and subject to Lee s mortgage. It appears from William Hammond s testimony, that it was a part of the contract of sale, that Peck should discharge those mortgages  and, indeed, as to Lee s, this is apparent from the very face of the conveyance by Budge to Peck. The defendant and Lapish and French, were perfectly conusant of Peek s title, and there is no pretence to say, that they have any better right than Peck would have. Nor does the answer of the defendant set up any superior equity or title in the defendant. It stands upon Peck s title in respect to these mortgages. What then is the state of the facts on this point? In June, 1801, Lee assigned his mortgage and judgment to Lapish  and afterwards, in October of the same year. Lapish made the release of the same mortgage to Budge, which has been already alluded to. This release purports, in consideration of five dollars, to release  all actions, causes of action, and demands, for or upon account of a certain mortgage deed, made by said Budge to John Lee, of a certain tract, &c. which said mortgage deed was afterwards, by said Lee. duly assigned to me, said Lapish.  Then comes this proviso:  Provided, however, that this release shall not be considered as in anywise affecting any right or title, which is or may be- claimed by me or any other person by any other deed from or under said Budge, the true purpose and intent hereof being to secure to those who claim the premises under John Peck a good title to the same.  It appears to me, that the real object of this proviso is incapable of being misunderstood. It is merely to operate as an extinguishment, in favor of Budge, of the very mortgage which Peck was bound to discharge under the conveyance to him by Budge, and which equitably devolved upon Peck's grantees. The proviso is designed to protect these grantees from any implication of an intention to release their title to the premises derived under Peck. What were these premises? Not the whole one hundred acres  but the whole, excepting McGlathry s acre. The release, therefore, was an execution of the original contract of Peck, and extinguished the mortgage in favor of Budge, as well to the acre of McGlathry as to the residue conveyed to Peck  and thus relieved Budge from his warranty to McGlathry. Lapish has the full security intended by the release in the ex-tinguishment of the mortgage, as to the premises derived from Peck  and it would be a violation of justice to revive an extinct mortgage to the prejudice of the parties, who, in the contemplation both of Peck and Budge, were to be relieved from it. The case is, if possible, still plainer as to the mortgage of Ginn and Treat. In June, 1801, Ginn, in consideration of five dollars, released his title to the whole lot to Budge  and in October, 1S03. Treat also, for the consideration of five shillings, released his title in the mortgage to Peck. The very instruments themselves demonstrate the intention of all the parties, that these mortgages should be extinguished  and are consistent only with the supposition, that the extin-guishment of them by Peek or his grantees constituted a part of the original contract between him and Budge on the original sale. The consideration of the conveyances by Lapish to Budge, and Ginn to Budge, and Treat to Peck, are all merely nominal, and indicate, in the most unequivocal manner, that the parties considered them as securities, that were to be deemed extinguished as foundations of right or title against Budge or his grantees. To revive them would, in my judgment, be a total departure, as well from the principles of law as of equity. It would be gross injustice to the plaintiffs. There is this additional circumstance, which is decisive against the defendant s right to put forth this defence, that he has shown no title to any part of the premises derived under Lapish, or under the assignment of the mortgage of Lee to him, or under the release of Ginn to Budge, or of Treat to Peck. His title to the premises is independent of all these transactions, and he is in no just sense a privy in the estate under them. It may also be observed, that until the release in 1S01, Budge was, by virtue of the mortgage of Peck to him in 1799, so far as respects Peck s grantees, the conditional owner of the whole lot. It is further objected, that McGlathry s conveyance from Budge was a fraud upon the latter, and ought not now to be upheld as a foundation of title. If this objection were well founded in point of fact, it would not avail the defendant. He has derived no-title to the one acre by grant from Budge  and it is very clear, that in a case of this-sort none, but a party or privy in estate, could set up a fraud upon the grantor, as the origin of an adverse title. But the evidence of the asserted fraud is too loose and unsatisfactory to be relied on for a moment. And the supposition of its existence is negatived, in the strongest manner, by the subsequent conveyances and conduct of Budge. It is to the last degree improbable, that, if the deed'  to McGlathry had been fraudulent, Budge would have recognized it in the subsequent deed to Peck  or that he and his heirs would have acquiesced in it, without any serious struggle, up to the present time. These are the principal points, upon which I deem it necessary to make any observations. There are some other suggestions, which, it is only necessary to say,- have not escaped the attention of the court  but they do not seem to me to require any minute answer. My judgment accordingly is, that as to all the land included in McGlnthry's deed, which extends only to the present bank of the river, the plaintiffs are entitled' to relief, and the defendant ought to be perpetually enjoined from claiming any title thereto  and as to all the rest of the land recovered by the judgment, the defendant is entitled to a writ of seisin. But this decree ought to be upon the terms, that the plaintiffs shall pay to the defendant all equitable charges, which he has upon the land of the plaintiffs, for expenses, for purchase money paid to the commonwealth, or taxes or other charges, with interest, to be ascertained by a master, in case either party shall request it. The district judge concurs in this opinion, and therefore a decree is to be entered accordingly. Decree for plaintiffs. Com. Dig.  Execution.  A 1: McNeil v. Bright, 4 Mass. 282  Gilbert v.

      "judges:   parties:  RULE S LESSEE v. PARKER. opinions:  By the Court. This is a proceeding by which a man s property is to be taken from him without the interference of a court, and not in the common course of law. It is a summary and an extraordinary proceeding. Whoever claims title under it must show that he has complied with all the requisites which the law has prescribed in order to guard against fraud and imposition. The advertisements required by the Act to precede a sale, ought to be proved to have been made, so as to satisfy a jury that they were made. Circumstances indicative of the fact may be received at this distance of time   and some such circumstances have been given in evidence in the present case, such as the production of one Gazette in which the advertisement appears. But there is one objection which the Court deems fatal. The surveyor s book describes the land and its situation, and states Grant to be the reputed owner. The collector s book states him to be the occupier or possessor, and it is proved that Grant lived in Kentucky. Had it appeared upon the collector s book that he was only the reputed owner, there would have been a publication as directed by the Act of 1798, ch. 92,   11, as well as the publication required by the 18th section. It is indeed argued, by the counsel for the defendant that the publication is only requisite in the case of an unknown person, whose personal property is intended to be seized by the collector for raising the taxes due, and is only preparatory to such seizure. I am of opinion, however, that it is equally necessary in the case of a person who is known, but is the resident of another State or country   and' that, in the case of an absentee, both advertisements are necessary, as directed by the 11th and 12th sections of the Act of 1798. As to the objection that a demand by the collector ought to have preceded the sale, that could not be, for the reputed owner was not in the collection district. Nor does the Court perceive the weight of the objection as to sending a statement of the taxes due to the collector of the district where Grant resided. The district spoken of in the Act meant one in the State, and under the care and superintendence of the same supervisor as the district from whence it must be sent. Whit side, for the plaintiff.

      "judges:   parties:  Abraham L. Pennock & James Sellers, Plaintiffs in Error vs. Adam Dialogue. opinions:  Mr Justice Siony delivered the opinion of the Court. This is a Writ of error to the circuit court of Pennsylvania. The original action was brought by the plaintiffs in error for an asserted violation of a patent, granted to them on the 6th of July 1818, for a new and useful improvement in the art of making leather tubes or hose, for conveying air, water, and other fluids. The cause was tried upon the general issue, and a verdict was found for the defendant, upon which judgment passed in his favour  and the correctness of that judgment is now in controversy before this court. At the trial, a bill of exceptions was taken to an opinion delivered by thecourt, in the charge to the jury, as follows, viz.  That the law arising upon the case was, that if an inventor makes his discovery public, looks on and permits others freely to use it, without objection or assertion of claim to the invention, of which the public might take notice  he abandons the inchoate right to the exclusive use of the invention, to which a patent would have entitled him had it been applied for before such use.. And, that it makes no difference in the principle, that the article so publicly used, and afterwards patented, was made by a particular individual, who did so by the private permission of the.inventor. And thereupon, did charge the jury, that if the evidence brings the case within the principle which had been stated.-the court were of opinion that the plaintiffs were riot entitled to a verdict.  The record contains, embodied in the bill of exceptions, the whole of the testimony and evidence offered at the trial,, by each party, in support of the issue. It is jery voluminous, and as no exception was taken to its competency, or sufficiency, either generally or for any particular purpose  it is not properly before this Court for consideration, and forms an expensive and unnecessary burthen upon the record. This Court has had occasion in many cases to express its regret, on account of irregular proceedings of this nature. There' was not the slightest necessity of putting any portion of the evidence in this case upon the record, since the opinion of the court delivered to the jury, presented a general principle of law, and the application of the evidence to it was left to the jury. In the argument at the bar, much reliance has been plated upon this evidence, by the counsel- for both parties. ( It has been said on behalf of the defendants in error  that it called for other and explanatory directions from the court, and that the omission of the court to give them in the charge, furnishes a good ground for. a reversal, as it would have furnished in the court below for . a new trial.. But it is no ground of reversal that the court below omitted to give directions to the jury upon any points of law which might arise in the cause,.where it was not requested by either party at the trial. It is sufficient for us that the court has given no erroneous directions. If either party deems any point presented by the evidence to be omitted in the charge, it is competent for such, party to require an opinion, from the court upon that point. If he does not, it is a waiver of it. The court cannot be presumed to do more, in ordinary cases, than to express its opinion upon the questions which the parties themselves have raised at the trial. On the other hand, the counsel for the defendant in error has endeavoured to extract from the same evidence, strong confirmations of th  charge of the court. But, for the reason already suggested, the evidence must be.laid out of the case, and all the reasoning founded on it falls. The. single question then is, whether the charge of the' court was correct in point of lavv. It has not been, and indeed cannot be denied, that an inventor may abandon his invention, and surrender or dedicate it to the public. This inchoate right, thus once gone, cannot afterwards be resumed at his pleasure  for, where gifts are once made to the public in this way,  they become absolute. . Thus, if a man dedicates a way, or other easement to the public, it is supposed to carry with it a permanent right of user: The question which generally arises at trials, is a question of fact, rather than of law  whether the acts or acquiescence of the party furnish in the given case, satisfactory proof of an abandonment or dedication of the invention to the public. But when all the facts are given, there does not seem any reason why the court may not state the legal conclusion deducible from them. In this view of the matter, the only question would be, whether, upon general principles, the facts stated by the court would justify the conclusion. In the case at bar  it is unnecessary-to consider whether the facts stated in the charge of the court would, upon general principles, warrant the conclusion drawn by the court, independently of any statutory provisions  because, we are of opinion, that the proper answer depends upon the true exposition of the act of congress, under which the present patent was obtained. The constitution of the United t tates has declared, that congress shall have power   to promote the progress of science and useful arts, by securing for limited, times,' to authors and inventors, the exclusive fight to their.respective writings and discoveries.  It contemplates, therefore, thal this exclusive right shall exist but for a limited period, and that the period shall be subject to the discretion of congress. The patent act, of the 21st of February, 1793, ch. 11, prescribes the terms and conditions and manner of obtaining patents for inventions  and proof of a strict compliance with them lies at the foundation of the title acquired by the patentee. The first seqtion provides,  that when any person or persons, being a citizen or citizens of the United States, shall allege that he or they have invented any new or useful art, machine, manufacture, or composition of matter, or any new or useful improvement on any art, machine, or composition of matter, not known or used before the application  and shall present a petition to the secretary of state, signifying, a desire of obtaining an exclusive property in the same, and praying that a patent may be granted therefor  it shall and may be lawful for the said secretary of state, to cause letters patent to be made out in the name of the United States, bearing teste by the President of the United States, reciting the.allegations and suggestions of the. said petition, and giving a short description of the said invention or discovery, and thereupon, granting to the said petitioner, &c.for a term not exceeding fourteen years, the full and exclusive right and liberty of making, constructing, using, and vending to others to be used, the said invention or discovery, &c.  The third section provides,   that every inventor, before he can receive a patent, shall swear, or affirm, that he does verily believe that he is the true inventor or discoverer of the art, machine, or improvement for which he solicits a patent.  The sixth section provides that the defendant shall be permitted to give in defence, to any action brought against him for an infringement of the patent, among other things,   that the thing thus secured by patent was not originally discovered by the patentee, but had been in use, or had been described in some publie work, anterior to the supposed discovery of the patentee.  These- are the only material clauses bearing upon the question now before the court  and upon the construction of them, there has been no inconsiderable diversity of opinion entertained among, the profession, in cases heretofore litigated. It is obvious to the careful inquirer, that many of the provisions of our patent act are derived from the principles and practice which have prevailed in the construction of that of England. It is doubtless true, as has been suggested at the bar, that where English statutes, such for instance, as the statute of frauds, and the statute of limitations  have been adopted into our own legislation  the known and settled construction of those statutes by courts of law, has been considered as silently incorporated into the acts, or has been received with- all the weight of authority. Strictjy speaking, that is not the case in respect to the English statute of monopolies  which contains an exception on which the grants of patents for inventions have issued in-that country. The language of that clause of the statute is not, as we shall presently see, identical with ours  but the construction of it adopted by the English courts, and the principles and practice which have long regulated the grants of their patents, as they must have been known and are tacitly, referred to in some of the provisions of our own statute, afford materials to illustrate it. , By the very terms of the first section of our statute, the v secretary of state is authorised-to grant a patent to any citizen applying for the same, who shall allege that he has invented a new and useful art, machine,, &c. &,c.   not known or used before the application?  The authority is a limited one,, and the party must bring himself within the. terms,, before he can derive any title to demand, or to hold a patent. ..What then is the true meaning of the words   not known or used before the application V They cannot mean that the thing invented was not known or used before the application bythe inventor himself, for' that would be to prohibit him from the only means of obtaining a patent. The use, as well as the knowledge of his invention, must be indispensable to enable him to ascertain its competency to the end proposed, as well as to perfect its component parts. The words then, to have any rational interpretation, must mean, not known or used by others, before the application. But how known or used1? If it were necessary, as it well might be, to employ others to assist in the original structure or use by the inventor himself  or if before his application for a patent his invention should be pirated by another, or used without his consent  it can scarcely be supposed, that the legislature had within its contemplation such knowledge or .use. We think, then, the true meaning must be, not known or used by the public, before the application. And, thus construed, there is much reason for the limitation thus imposed by the act. While one great object was, by holding out a reasonable reward to inventors, and giving them an exclusive right to their inventions for a limited period, to stimulate the efforts of genius    the main object was  to promote the progress of science and useful arts   and this could be done best, by giving the public at large a right to make, construct, use, and vend the thing invented, at as early a period as possible  having a due regard to the rights of the inventor. If an inventor should be permitted to hold back from the knowledge of the public the secrets of his invention  if he should for a long period of years retain the monopoly, and make, and sell his invention publicly, and thus gather the whole profits of it, relying upon his superior skill and knowledge of the structure  and then, and then only, when the danger of competition should force him to secure the exclusive right, he should be allowed to take out a patent, and thus exclude the public from any farther use than what should be derived under jt during his fourteen years  it would materially retard the progress of science and the useful arts, and give' a premium to those who should be least prompt to communicate their discoveries. A provision, therefore, that should withhold from an inventor the privilege of an exclusive right, unless he should, as early as he.should adovv the public use, put the public in possession of his secret, and commence the running of the period, that should limit that right  would not be deemed unreasonable . It might be expected to find a place in a wise prospective legislation on such a subject. If it was already found in the jurisprudence of the mother country, and had not been considered inconvenient there  it would not be unnatural that it should find a place in our own. Now, in point of fact, the statute of 21 Jac. ch. 3,- commonly called the statute of monopolies, does contain exactly such a provision. That act, after prohibiting monopolies generally, contains, in the sixth section, an exception in favour of   letters patent and grants of privileges for fourteen years or undery of the sole working or making of any manner of new manufactures within this realm, to the true and first inventor and-inventors of such manufactures, which others, at the time of making such letters patent and grants, shall not use.  ' Lord Coke, in his commentary upon this clause or proviso, (3 Inst. 184,) says that the letters patent   must be of such manufactures, which any other at the time of making such letters patent did not use  for albeit it were newly invented, yet if any other did use it at the making of the letters patent, or grant of the privilege, it is declared and enacted to be void by this act.  The use here referred to has always been understood to be a public use, and not a private or surreptitious use in fraud of the inventor. In the c'ase of Wood vs. Zimmer, 1 Holt's N. P. Rep. 58, this doctrine was fully recognised by lord chief justice Gibbs. There the inventor had suffered the 'hing invented to be sold, and go into public use for four months before the grant of his patent  and it was held by the court, that on this account the patent was utterly void. Lord chief justice Gibbs said,   To entitle a man to a patent, the invention must be new to the world. The public sale of that which is afterwards made the subject of a patent, though sold by the inventor only, makes the patent void.  By   invention,  the learned judge undoubtedly meant, as .the context abundantly show's, not the abstract discovery, but the thing invented  not the new secret principle, but the manufacture' resulting from it. The words of our statute are not identical with those of the statute of James, but it can scarcely admit of doubt, that they must have been within the contemplation of those by whom it was framed, as well as the construction which had been put upon them by Lord Coke. But if, there were no such illustrative comment, it is difficult to conceive how any other interpretation could fairly be put upon these words. We are not at liberty to reject words which are sensible in the place where they occur, merely because they may be thought, in some cases, to import a hardship, or tie up beneficial rights within very close limits. If an invention is used by the. public, with the consent .of the inventor, at the time of his application for a patent  how can the court say, that his case is, nevertheless, such as the act was intended to protect? If such a public use is not a use within the meaning of the statute, what other use is?. If it be a use within the meaning of the statute, how can the court extract the case from its operation, and support a patent, where the suggestions of the patentee are not true, and the conditions on which alone the grant was authorised to be made, do not exist? In such a case, if the court could perceive no reason for'the restrictions,' the will of the legislature must still be obeyed. It cannot and ought not to be disregarded, where it plainly applies to the case. But if the restriction may be perceived to have a foundation in sound policy, and be an effectual means of accomplishing the legislative objects,' by bringing inventions early into public and unrestricted'use  and above all, if such policy has been avowed- and acted upon in like cases in laws having similar objects  there is very urgent reason to suppose, that tlie act in those terms embodies the real legislative intent, and ought to receive that construction. It is not wholly insignificant in this point of view, that the first patent act passed by congress on this subject, (act of 1790, ch. 34, [ch. 7.) which the present act repeals, uses the words   not known or used before,  without adding the words   the applicati nand in connexion with the structure of the sentence in which they stand, might have been referred either to the time of the invention, or of the application. The addition of the latter words in the patent act of 1793, must, therefore, have been introduced, ex industria, and with the cautious intention to clear away a doubt, and fix the original and deliberate meaning of the legislature. The act of the 17th of April 1800, ch. 25, which extends the privileges of the act of 1793 to inventors whcTare aliens  contains a proviso declaring,   that every patent which shall be obtained, pursuant to the act for any invention, art or discovery, which it shall afterwards appear had been known or used previous to such application for a patent, shall be void.  This proviso certainly certifies the construction of the act of 1793, already asserted'  for there is not any reason. to suppose, that the legislature intended to confer on aliens, privileges, essentially different from those belonging to citizens. On the contrary, the enacting clause of the act of 1800 purports to put both on the same footing  and the proviso seems added as a- gloss or explanation of the original act. The only real doubt which has arisen upon this exposition of the statute, has been created by the words of the sixth section already quoted. That section admits the party sued to give in his defence as a bar, that   the thing thus secured by patent was not originally, discovered by the patentee, but had been in use anterior to the supposed discovery of the patentee.  It has been asked,' if the legislature intended to bar the party vfrom a patent in consequence of a mere prior use, although he was the inventor  why were not the words   anterior to the application  substituted, instead of  ^anterior to the supposed discovery? If a mere use'-of the thing invented before the application were sufficient to bar the right, then, although the party may have been the-first and true inventor, if another person, either innocently as a second inventor, or piratically, were to use it without the knowledge of the first inventor  his right would be gone. In respect to a use by piracy, it is not clear that, any such fraudulent use is within the intent of the statute  and upon general principles it might well be held excluded. In respect to the case of a second invention, it is questionable at least, whether, if by such second invention a public use was already acquired, it could be deemed a case within the protection of the act. If the public were already in possession and c.ommon use of an Invention fairly and without fraud, there might be sound reason for presuming, that the legislature did not intend to grant an exclusive right- to any one to monopolize that which was already common. There would be no quid pro quo   no price for the exclusive right or monopoly conferred upon the inventor for fourteen years. Be this as it may, it is certain that the sixth section is not necessarily repugn nt to'-the construction which the words of the first section require and justify. The sixth section . certainly does not enumerate all the defences which a party may makgdn a suit brought against him for-violating a patent. One obvious omission is, where he uses if under a license or grant from the inventor. The sixth section in the clause under consideration, may well be deemed merely affirmative of what would be the. result from the general principles of law applicable .to other parts of the statute. It gives the right to the first and true inventor and to him only  if known of used before his supposed discovery He is not the first, although' he may be a true inventor  and that i is the case, to which the clause lobks. Rut-it is not inconsistent with this Hncrrine._t.hat although he is the first, as  -welbas-tbgf7TgemventdrTyet4f-lie~?lraIl--ptHH:t-fflto--pubi-ieuse,-- or spfl il_for-publtc-nsrrbefbre*iie applies for a patent., thai-   this .should--fcrnTsh   another bar to his claim. . In this view an interpretation is given to every clause of the statute without. introducing any inconsistency, or interfering with the  ordinary meaning of its language. No public policy is overlooked  and no injury can Ordinarily occur to the first inventor, which is not in some sort the result of fits own laches or voluntary inaction. It is admitted that .the subject is not wholly free from difficulties  but upon most deliberate consideration we are all of opinion, that the true construction of the act is, that the first inventor cannot acquire a good title to a patent: if he suiters-the thing invented to go into-nnhfir use, p blicly sold for use, before he makes application for a pa-~T nt. HTs voluntary act or acquiescence in the public sale and use is an abandonment of .his right  or rather Creates a disability to. comply with the terms and conditions on which alone the secretary of state is authorized to grant him a* patent. The opinion.of the circuit court was therefore perfectly correct  and the judgm nt.is affirmed with costs. This cause came.-on to be heard .on the transcript of the 'record from the circuit court of the United States for the district of Pennsylvania, and was argp 1 by counsel  on. consideration whereof, it is the opinion of this Court, that there is no error in the judgment of the said circuit court. .

The record contains, embodied in the bill of exceptions, the whole of the testimony and evidence offered at the trial of the, cause by each party in support of the issue. It is very voluminous, and as no exception was taken to its competency or sufficiency, either generally or for any particular purpose  it is not properly before this court ,for consideration, and forms an expensive and unnecessary burthen upon the record. This Court has had occasion, in many cases, to express its regret on account of irregular proceedings of this nature. There was not the slightest necessity of putting any portion of the evidence in this case upon the record  since the opinion of the court, delivered to the jury, presented a general principle of law  and the application of the evidence to it was left to the jury. [15] It is no ground of reversal, that the court below omitted to give directions to the jury upon any points of law which might arise in'the cause, Where it was not requested by either party at the trial. It is sufficient for us, that the court has given no erroneous directions. [16] If either party considers any poipt presented by the evidence, omitted in the charge of the court, it is competent for such party to require an opinion from the court upon that point. The court cannot be presumed to do more In ordinary cases, than to express its opinion upon questions, which the parties themselves have raised on the trial. [16] It has not been, atad indeed it cannot be denied, that an inventor may abandon his invention, and surrender or dedicate it to the.public. This inchoate right, thus gone, cannot afterwards be resumed.at his pleasure  for when gifts are once made to the public in this way, they become absolute. The question which generally arises on trials is a question of fact, rather than of law  whether the acts or acquiescence of the party, furnish, in the given case, satisfactory proof of an abandonment, or dedication of the invention to the public. [16] It is obvious, that many of the provisions of our patent act, are derived from the principles and practice which have prevailed in the construction of the law of . England in relation to patents. [18] Where English statutes, such for instance as the statute of frauds, and the statute of limitations, have been adopted into our own legislation  the known and settled construction of those statutes by courts of law, has been considered as silently incorporated into the acts  or has been received with all the weight of authority. This is not the case with the English statute of monopolies, which contains aq exception, on which the grants of patents for inventions have issued in that country.' The language of that clause in the statute is not identical with the patent law of the United States  but the construction of it adopted by the English courts, and the'principles and practice which have long .regulated, the grants of their patents  as they must have been known, and are tacitly referred to in some of the provisions of our own statute, afford materials to illustrate it.

[19] If an inventor should he permitted to hold back from the knowledge of the public the secrets of his invention  if he should, for a long period of years,- retain the monopoly, and make and sell his invention publicly  and thus gather the whole profits of it, relying upon his superior skill and knowledge of the structure  and then, and then only, when the danger of competition should force him to procure the exclusive right, he should be allowed to take out a patent, and thus exclude the public from any further use, than what Should be derived undSrit, duriffg hTs fddrfeen'years  it wouSTThateriaily retard the progress of science and the useful .arts   and give a premium to those who' should be least prompt to communicate their discoveries. [19] If an invention is used by the public, with the cpnsent of the inventor, at the time of' his application for a patent  how can the Court say, that his case is nevertheless such as the. act was intended to protect ? If such a public use is not a use.within the meaning of the statute  how can the Court extract the case from its operation, and support a patent, when the suggestions of the patentee were not true   and the conditions, on which alone the grant was authorised, do not exist ? [21] The true construction of tire patent law is, that the first inventor cannot acquire a good title to a patent, if he suffers the thing invented to go into public use, or to be publicly sold for use, before he makes application for a patent. This voluntary act, or acquiescence in the public sale or use, is an abandonment of his right  or rather, creates   disability to comply with the terms and conditions of the law  on which alone the'secretary-of state is authorised to-grant him a patent. [23] THIS case was brought before the Court, on a writ of error to the circuit court for the eastern district of Pennsylvania. In that court,' the plaintiffs in eryor had instituted their suit against the defendants, for an infringement of a patent right, for   an improvement in tber^aft ot making tubes or hose for conveying air, water, and other fluids.  . The invention claimed by the patentees, was in the mode of making the hose so that the parts so joined together would be tight, and as capable of resisting the pressure as any other part of the machine. TJhe bill, of exceptions, which came up with the record, contained the whole evidence given in the trial of the cause   in the circuit court. The invention, for which the' patent right was claimed, was completed in 1811  and the'letters patent were obtained in 1818, In this interval, upwards of thirteen thousand feet of h se,. constructed according to the invention of the patentees, had been made and sold in. the city Of Philadelphia. One, Samuel Jenkins, by the permission of, arid under an agreement between the plaintiffs as to the price  had made and' sold jtbe hose invented by the plaintiffs, and supplied several hose companies in the city of Philadelphia with the same. Jenkins, during much of the time, wasin the service of the plaintiffs, and J  T beeri-^instructed by~them in the art' of making the hose.. There was no positive evidence, that the agreement between Jenkins and the plaintiffs in error was known to,, or concealed from the public. The plaintiffs,-on the trial, did not allege or offer evidence to prove that they had delayed making, application for a patept, for the purpose of improvingjbeir invention  or that from 1811 to 1818, any important modifications or alterations had been made in their riveted hose. The plaintiffs claimed before the jury, that all the hose which h adheep ma.dft_a.nfl sold to-the public,, prior to their  patent7~had been-feonstr Rted-afid,vended by Jenkins Under- ~~ their permission     Upon the whole evidence in. the case, th  circuit court charged the jury:  We are clearly of opinion that if an inventor makes his discovery public,' looks on and permits others freely to use it, without objection or. assertion of claim to. the invention, of which the public might take notice.  he abandons the inchoate right to the exclusive use of the invention, to which a patent would have entitled him, had it beqn applied for.before such use. And we think it makes no difference in the principle, that the article so publicly used, and afterwards patented, .was made by a particular individual, who did so by the private permission of the inventor. As long as an inventor keeps to himself the subject of his discovery, the public cannot be injured: and even if. it be made public, but accompanied by. an assertion of the inventor s claim to the discovery, those who should make or use the subject of the invention would at least be put upon their guard. But if the public, with the knowledge and the tacit consent of the inventor, is permitted to use   the invention without opposition, it is a fraud upon the public afterwards to take out a patent. It is possible that the inventor may not have intended to give the benefit of his discovery to the public  and may have supposed that by giving permission to a particular individual to construct for others the thing patented, he could not be presumed to have done so. But it is not a question of intention, which is involved in the principle which we have laid down  but of legal inference, resulting from the conduct of the inventor, and affecting the interests of the public. It is for the jury to say, whether the evidence brings this case within the principle which has been stated. If it does, the court is of opinion that the- plaintiffs are not entitled -to a Verdict.  To this charge the plaintiffs excepted, and the jury gave a verdict for the defendant. Mr Webster,, for the plaintiff in error, contended, 1. That the invention, being of such a nature that the use of it, for the purpose of trying its utility and bringing it to perfection, must necessarily be open and public  the implication of a waiver or abandonment of. the right, fur- . nished by such public use, is rebutted by the circumstance that the article was made and sold only by one individual  an,d that individual was authorized and permitted so to do . by the inventors., 2. That the use of an invention, however public, if it be . by the permission and under the continual exclusive claim of the inventor  does not take away his right, except after an. unreasonable lapse of time, or gross negligence, in applying for a patent. 3. That the jury should have been instructed, that, if they found the riveted hose, which was in use by the hose companies, had been all made and sold by Jenkins, and by nb one else, pnot to the grant of the patent  and that he was permitted by the inventors, .under their agreement, so to make and sell the same , that such use of the invention, not being adverse to. their claim, did not take away their exclusive right,. nor imply an abandonment of it to the public, . 4. That, if th y found the hose had not been made or sold, prior to the grant of the patent,. by any person but Jenkins,, then the giving of permission to him, being in it-, self aii assertion of claim, was nbt^ a dedication to the public  and that the piiblic, by purchasing and using the hose, thus made by the permission of the inventors, acquired  no title to the invention^-b t, on the contrary,' if the price paid included a premiuin for the invention,, the public by so purchasing, admitted the right of'the inventors. 5. That, at any rate, there being no us , by the public, of this invention, iit should have b en left to the jury, to say, whether, tinder all the circumstances, considering the nature of the invention, and the time necessary to perfect it  the plaintiffs h ve. been guilty, of negligence, in not sooner applying for a patent .' '   ' Mr Webster stated, that the question to be decided by the Court laid within a.narrow compass. The defence, set up was, that the plaintiffs had suffered their, invention to be used before their application for a patent  and had thus lost all right to the exclusive us  of it. The Court, in this case, would be called upon to reverse the English decision relativ  to abandonments  for it wa > admitted, that those cases had gone to the whole extent of the principles applied to this Case in the circuit court. Those cases have decided, that any public use of an invention, even for experiment, renders it no longer a new machine. In the courts of the United States, a more just view had been talcen of the rights of inventors. The laws of the Uriited States were intended to protect, those rights, and to confer benefits  while the provisions hi the statute of England, under which patents are issued, are'exceptions to the law prohibiting monopolies. Hence, the construction of the British statute had been exceedingly straight and narrow, and different from the more liberal interpretation of our laws. By the decisions of  ur courts, there must be a voluntary abandonment, or negligence, or unreasonable delay in obtaining letters patent, to destroy the right of the patentee. Goodyear vs. Mathews, Paine's Rep. 300  Morris vs. Huntington, Id. 348,. The exception to the charge of the court is  that the jury should have been instructed to decide upon the evidence, whether the plaintiff meant to abandon his invention by the permission to Jenkins to use it. Jenkins must be considered as the private agent of the inventors  artd their agreement with him, under which. he made the hose, is to be considered rather as an assertion of their exclusive right to the invention, than a surrender of it. By omitting to leave to the jury this question of an intention to abandon, the case was erroneously withdrawn from' them. The rights of the parties also entitled them to have the causes of their delay in patenting their invention inquired of by the jury. As the case is presented on the bill of exceptions, the court in their charge undertook to state the whole law of the subject matter' to the jury  and the omission to instruct them on any one point is error. If in this charge of the court any thing is omitted which was matter of law for the jury, it is. misdirection. In a case in Massachusetts, said to be reported in 4th Mason s Rep., it was left- to the jury to decide whether seventeen years  delay could be accounted for. Under the provisions of the laws  of the United States, the right is created by the invention, and not by the patent. The court, therefore, may have misled the jury, iii stating that the plaintiffs allowed the invention to be used. The thing invented was only permitted to be used. The suggestion, that by adopting the language of the English statute, the cases decided in England upon that statute are adopted, may be answered ,by a reference to those cases. They have all arisen within a few years, since the enactment of our law  and, except the dictum of Lord Coke in 2d Institute, the authorities are all of modern date. If this Court shall be of opinion, that as no instructions were particularly asked upon the questions raised here, the court below were not. bound to notice them in the charge,, and that the court did not undertake to decide the whole law  the plaintiff in error can make out no case here. But if this Court shall consider the questions now submitted doubtful, as the rights''of the plaintiffs may not have been fully investigated j by sending the case back to the circuit court, a more full investigation of all the. points involved in it may be made.- Mr Sergeant, for the defendant, insisted, 1. That mere invention gives no right to an exclusive use, unless a patent is obtained  and that if at a time when no right is infringed, the public fairly acquire possession of it, the inventor cannot, by subsequently obtaining a patent, take it away. 2. That the inventor, by abstaining from getting a patent encouraged the public to use the article freely, and thus   benefited his own manufactory. And he is not at liberty, vyhen this advantage is exhausted, to turn round, and en-deavour to reach another and a different kind of advantage, by appropriating the use exclusively to himself.   In the circuit where this cause was- tried,. ,it was not the practice to ask the court for special instructions, to the jury. After the evidence had been closed, and counsel heard,- a charge was given to the jury, according to the nature of the case, upon the points made by counsel, .or .which . might suggest themselves to the mind of the judge. It was competent, however, to either party, after the charge, to ask the opinion of the court upon any point supposed to have been omitted, which was material to the decision. In this case, no such request had been made  and no objection can now be made to the charge, for any imputed omission. The only question was, whether the principles   laid down to the jury for. their guidance were.correct, and'according to law, in the particular excepted to.. The charge must of course be considered with reference to the facts, the whole of which appear, upon the record. The petition of the plaintiffs to the secretary of state stated,. in the words of the patent law, that they were the inventors-of a  n vv and useful improvement,    not .known or used before their application.  The   application  was made, in July 1818. Their averment therefore, upon which they obtained' their patent was, that the  rivet hose was >a new invention, not   known or used  before the year 1818.' The facts proved upon the trial were, that the invention had been completed and published in the year 1811, s.even years before the application. That during all that period, it. had been known and used  s common public property, (and not as private property) which any one might use.as piihlicly' known. And that it was so known and used, with the know- . ledge of those who now claim to be the inventors  without . any assertion or claim op their part of exclusive, property, and without notice df intention to make'such claim. There was not a single circumstance offered, to explain the delay. Ther  was an attempt to show, that tK  making ,of the article for use, was limited by the authority and permission of the plaintiffs, and thence to infer that they did not intend to give it to the public, .A witness, produced by them, and the only person who appeared to have made the article, declared in substance,   that he was taught by the plaintiffs in 1811 to make hose  that in that year he made a certain quantity of-it for the Philadelphia Hose Company, plaintiffs being members of the committee  and that by permission of the plaintiffs he made about thirteen thousand feet of hose, for different hose companies, from 1811 to the time of granting the patent.  Thus, in point of fact, nearly two miles and a half in length of hose, had been made at different times in the course of seven years before the patent  and had been sold to different hose companies  not to experime'nt with, in order to bring the invention to perfection  but for public use, as a thing already completed, and adapted to the purpose of arresting the ravages of fire. It was so used  and from the year 1811 to the year 1818, it was never materially altered or improved. The thing patented in 1818 was precisely the thing invented, completed and used in 1811. Were the plaintiffs, under these circumstances,, entitled to a patent1? or could a patent, thus obtained, be supported1? The authorities upon the subject are decisive. He did not admit that the weight of judicial or legal opinion in England was lessened by the supposed difference in the policy of the two countries, or that in fact any such difference existed. . It was true, that the process or mode of legislation w.as varied according to the existing state of things. The statute of James was made to abolish monopolies  but it saved, by exception, the rights of the inventors of new and useful inventions, who had before enjoyed exclusive privileges. The constitution of the United States and the act of congress  on the ' ^ntrary, having no monopolies to deal with  created exclusive privileges in favour of the same description of persons. The one preserved to them a pre-existing monopoly, and the other conferred it upon them. Both were influenced by the merits of the inventor, and the public advantage of encouraging inventive genius. And they were equally influenced by these considerations  for it required at least as strong a sense of'their just claims to distinction, to except new and useful inventions from the statutory odium and denunciation, of monopolies, as it did to confer upon them the Benefits of monopoly by direct enactment. There was no r ason, therefore, why the judicial construction of the statute of James,. (from which our act of congress was in this respect copied,) which had become, as it were, incorporated with, and part of the statutej should not be as much respected as in the instance of any other statute. The adoption of the language of the statute, was the adoption also of its settled interpretation. It could.not surely be insisted that England was wanting in intelligence to discern the value of genius, or in liberality to reward it  or that there was a prevailing bias in her judiciary, towards an unjust restriction of the rights of meritorious inventors. The sentiment of the nation, and the government, in all its .branches, was the opposite Qf this. Before referring to the cases, it might be. well,, however, to examine the matter a little upon principle. What is the right of an inventor1? It is the right, given to him by the law, to apply for and obtain a patent for his invention. The patent, when duly obtained, secures to him the exclusive enjoyment. Has he any other right before he obtains a patent than the one just stated1? It is obvious that he has not. This, then, is what the learned judge, in his charge, styles, with peculiar aptness, an inchoate right  that is, a right to have a title upon complying with the terms and conditions of the law: It is like an inchoate right to land, or an inceptive right to land, well known in some of the states, and every where accompanied with the condition, that to be made available, it must be prosecuted with due diligence, io the consummation or completion of the title. If .the condition be not complied with, the right is abandoned or-lost, and the rights of others are let in. The . abandonment is not a question of intention of the.party, but it is the legal construction of his acts or omissions. Had the plaintiffs ever such an inchoate right1? According to the opinion of the judge, they undoubtedly had such a right by their invention in 1811. Then, they could have made out the case required by the first section of the act of congress   they could have stated with truth, that the thing invented   was not known or used before their application.  But in the year 1818 it was no longer true. It might be stated, .but it could not be truly stated. They were, unable to comply with the condition-of law. For, if the inventor, as was the case here, voluntarily permit his invention to be known and used, as a thing hot intended to be patented, how can he make this statement1? By so doing, he abandons his inchoate right, he proclaims to the world that he does not mean to secure it by patent, and every one is at liberty to consider it abandoned  because every ope acquainted with the law knows that he has incurred a disability. This is the inevitable legal construction of his conduct, and is altogether independent.of his intention fun-less we suppose the act to be guilty of the absurdity of requiring that to be stated which it does not require to be true. But the terms-of the act are in this respect too plain to admit of a doubt. Suppose an applicant should state, that his invention had been known and used for seven years before his application, could, he obtain a patent? Suppose he.should state, that he had always intended to reserve to himself a right to obtain a patent, would that help him? Or, if he should state that it had been so known and used, osly-by his permission? The language of the act is plaih and imperative. There is no'scope for interpretation. The prescribed conditionds express. And there is no doubt th t it was the intention of congress to refer to the   application,  as the period before which the-thing was not known or used  for in the subsequent act of 17-th April .1800, conferring the privileges of the patent law upon resident, aliens, the same word is used for the same purpose'. And it is- declared that the patent shall be void if the thing patented was known or used before the application. Act of 17th April  800, section!. It is not contended, that if the invention should be pirated, the use or knowledge, obtained by the piracy, or otherwise obtained without the knowledge or consent and without the fault of the inventor  would bar him from getting a patent. Nor is it contended that his own knowledge and use would be a bar. The latter is a necessary exception out of the generality of the terms of the law, because every inventor must know his invention, and must use it to the extent of ascertaining its usefulness, before he applies for a patent. The former is a case where there is no fault on the part of the inventor. . But it is contended, that the inventor who means to rely upon a patent must make his application within a reasonable time  and that if he permit his invention to be publicly known and used before he applies, he cannot obtain a patent. He abandons his right, if he sell it for public use himself, and a fortiori, if he permit another so to sell it. There is a cautious intimation in the charge, that possibly there might be some saving efficacy in accompanying the use with an assertion of claim by the inventor. And it is also put as a circumstance against the plaintiffs (which was clearly in e.vid n'ce) that there was no such assertion or notice. The charge is theiefore applicable only to a case of unqualified public use, without notice or assertion of claim. That such a notice would be available, or that there can be any other assertion of claim than the legal assertion by applying for a patent  are propositions which it is not now necessary to examine. They were not affirmatively laid down by the court, nor otherwise adverted u> than for the purpose of showing that the facts did not entitle the plaintiffs to the benefit of them. They cannot therefore complain. Whether such assertions or notice, contradicted by the acts of the inventor, will be available, is a question not decided below. Certain it is, that a secret permission given to their own agent, can no more be an assertion or notice, than a resolution locked up in their own breasts. The construction contended for is in accordance with the policy of the law. Patents are intended to be granted for a limited time, beginning with the invention. He who asks for one must describe his invention with such certainty as will ensure to the public its use, when the patent.expires  and at the expiration of the time, the thing invented is public' property. The inventor, to enjoy its benefits, must place his whole reliance upon it. Is it competent for him,' then, to secure to himself the advantages. of his own peculiar knowledge and skill, as long as these will'avail' him, and when they ar  exhausted, to apply for a patent1? There are many inventions, the secret of which is not at once discoverable from an inspection of the thing invented. The inventor may keep that as long as he can. He may have extraordinary skill or methods of working which will enable him-to keep the market to himself. May he enjoy these exclusive privileges for seven years,  rid then obtain a patent for fourteen more ? He would then have the exclusive us  for twenty-one years. If for seven, why not for fourteen, or twenty-one, or. any other assignable time1? The moment that his invention comes' into the m st common or public use, is the moment when he applies for a patent. When the public have fully got possession of it, he seeks to withdraw it from' the. common stock and appropriate it to himself. This is directly contrary to the design of the l Vv. It extends the term, and inverts the order of proceeding. The inconveniences would be very great.-   Those who - were engag d in making the article must stop. Those who had arranged for making it must abandon their arrangements.   Those, who had- employed their time in learning to make it must los  their time arid their labour. And even a bona fide inventor, who had discovered the same thing by his oWn study and experiments, would be deprived  of the fruits of his ingenuity  ri'd exertions.1 And why ? Simply because, th'  first inventor did not choose sooner to take, out a patent, as he might have done:  The^conditions-of the law b irig such as he can comply with,  and.ought'to comply with   he postpones-a compliance for'his own profit, and leads the-community into an injurious error. ' If it be designed, it is a wrong. Ifit be without design, it is negligence.. Ought he to be benefited by his own wrong or negligence ^ The authorities are against him. He cited 3' Inst. 184   Wood us. Zimmer, 1 Holt s N. P. Rep. 58  Whittemore vs. Cutter,- ! Gall. 482 and . referred to Evans vs. Eaton, 1 Peters s C. C. Rep. 348  Thompson us. Haight, 1 U.S. Lata Journal, 563. He then examined the several points stated for the defendant, contending that some of them were unsupported by t.he facts, and others by the law. Under the second he argued that there had been an  unreasonable lapse of time,  and  gross negligence.  That seven years (the period here) unexplained were beyond all reasonable bounds. He contended, also, that due diligence^ where there were no circumstances of explanation, was a.question of law  and that it consisted in applying for a patent as soon, after the invention was completed, as could reasonably be done: and, finally, that due diligence required that the application should be made before the thing invented was publicly known and used with the consent of the inventor\n",
      "Choice 1:\n",
      "judges:   parties:  James Stimpson, Plaintiff in error, v. The West Chester Railroad Company, Defendants. opinions:  Mr. Justice McLEAN delivered the opinion of the court. The plaintiff brought an action against the defendant for an infringement of his patent, for a   new and useful improvement in the mode of turning short curves on railroads.  The questions for decision arise on exceptions to the charge of the court to the jury. /And here it may be proper to remark, that the exceptions are to. the charge as published, at length, and not to the points ruled by the court, as is the correct practice. Under the peculiar circumstances of this case, the court will not dismiss the writ of error upon this ground, but it is expected that a different course will hereafter be pursued. On the 21st of August, 1831, the plaintiff obtained a patent for an invention or improvement in the application of the flanches of the wheels on one side of railroad carriages' and of the treads of the wheels on the other side, to turn short curves upon railroads. The specifications of this patent being defective, it was surrendered the 26th of September, 1835, and a renewed one obtained, in order, as proved,  to limit and confine it to the turning short curves in streets, &c., by leaving out certain matters in it respecting the crossing of tracks or roads, and the passing over turnabouts, and to define the subject-matter of the patent more clearly, without its being necessary to refer to that simultaneously obtained, for forming and using cast or wrought-iron plates,  &c. . In his charge, the judge said to the jury,     It clearly appears that the defendants constructed their railroad with the plaintiff s curves in 1834, one year or more before the plaintiff s application for his renewed patent  consequently, they may continue its use without liability to the plaintiff. ? The patent was surrendered, and a new one obtained, under, the third section of the   Act concerning patents,  of the 3d of July, 1832-  and the correctness of the above opinion is to be ascertained by a reference to the proviso of that section. It is there declared,     No public use or privilege of the invention so patented, derived from or after the grant of the- original patent, either under any special license of the invehter, or without jthe consent of the patentee that there' shall be a free public use thereof, shall, in any manner, prejudice his right of recovery for any use or violation of his invention, after the grant of such new patent as aforesaid.  The charge of infringement, in the declaration, is laid some years after the new patent, so that the question does not arise, whether an action could be sustained for a violation of the right prior to the corrected patent. The above proviso would seem to be susceptible of but one construction   and that is, that the patentee may sustain an action   for any use or violation of his invention after the grant of the new patent.  Now it is plain that no prior use of the defective patent can authorize the use of. the invention after the emanation of the renewed patent under the above section. To give to the patentee the fruits of his invention, was the object of the provision   and this object would be defeated, if a right could be founded on a use subsequent to the original p tent and prior to the renewed one. The thirteenth section of the act  f the 4th of July, 1836, which remodelled the patent law in this respect, made no material change in the act of 1832. The words ip the latter act are,     And the patent, so reissued, together with the corrected description and specification, shall have the same effect and Operation- in law, on the trial of all actions hereafter commenced for causes subsequently accruing, as though the same had been originally filed in such corrected form, before the issuing out of the original patent.  Now any person using an invention protected by a renewed patent subsequently to the date of this act is guilty of an infringement, however long he may hav  used the same after the date of the defective and surrendered patent. The Circuit Court relied upon the seventh section of the act of the 3d of March, 1839, as sustaining their construction in regard to the use of the invention after the renewed patent. But- that section has exclusive reference to an original application for a patent, and not to a renewal of it. We think the court erred in their instruction to the jury, above stated.   In their charge, the court said,     The use of grooves was not claimed and was no part of the thing patented in 1831, for turning short curves, but was a part of the thing patented in 1835.    That it was an essential part of the invention.  And further,   in taking the statement   of Dr. Jones    as proof of the facts there existing, our opinion is, that, connected with the publication in the Journal of the Franklin Institute, in 1832, when the matter was fresh in his recollection, and the specification in the new patent, the old one was invalid and inoperative, by reason of noncompliance with the requisites of the act of 1793. That it did not embrace the groove, which was essential to its validity, that the new patent is not the same invention, and that the plaintiff has not made out a case of such   inadvertence, accident, or mistake,  as justified the issue of the new patent, inasmuch as it appears, from the patent for plates on railroads issued at the same time with the one for short curves, that he had known and described the grooves.  The original patent, as proved hy Dr. Jones, was burnt with the patent-office, and no part of the specifications is preserved, except that which was published by the witness in the Franklin Journal. That publication does not purport to give the whole of the specifications, and, consequently, the claim is not limited by the notice in that journal. Doctor Jones, speaking of the patent issued in 1831, says,     The main defect, in my judgment, of the original specifications in the patent for turning short curves was- the- omission of the mention of the groove ih the inner rail. I believe, however, that it was alluded to in the specifications, but the description of it was contained principally j if not wholly, in the specification of the patent-for forming and using cast-iron or wrought plates,  &c. That there was a defect in regard to-.the grooves, in the specifications of the first patent is shown, and also that the patent was surrendered in order to remedy that defect. But whether this vitiated the patent is not a question in this case, as it does not affect the right now asserted, if the first patent were void. Whether the new patent was substantially for a different invention from the first one, was a question for the jury on the evidence. But the court ruled this point, withdrawing the facts from the jury.   The witness thinks    that in the first patent the grooves were alluded to,  but the terms us d are not recollected by him  and as the patent has been burnt, they cannot now be proved. We think the Circuit Court erred in. not leaving the jury to act upon the facts, as regards the difference between the original and the renewed patent- On the facts, we should draw a different conclusion from that which was given to the jury by the Circuit Court. An allusion to grooves in this specification, as more particularly described in the other patent, would at least show the intention of the patentee, if it did not make good his patent. By the thirteenth section of the act of 1836,   if the patent shall be inoperative or invalid, by reason of ,a defective or insufficient description or specification,  &c.,   if the error has or shall have arisen by inadvertency, accident, or mistake, and without any fraudulent or deceptive intention, it shall be lawful   to surrender it, &c. Now, as in granting the renewed patent,.the officers of the government act under the above Provisions, their decision must at least be considered as prima facie evidence that the claim for a renewal was within the statute. But this would not be conclusive against fraud in the surrender and renewal, which, on the evidence, would be a matter for the jury. And we suppose that the inquiry in regard to .the surrender is limited to the fairness of the transaction. In whatever manner the mistake or inadvertence may have occurred is immaterial. The action of the government in renewing the patent must be considered as closing this point, and as leaving open for inquiry,, before the court and jury, the question of fraud only. The judgment of the Circuit Court is reversed, and the pause remanded to that court, with instructions to award a venire fa ias de novo. attorneys:  The case was argued by Mr. J. R. Ingersoll and Mr. J. R. Ingersoll, for the plaintiff in error, and Mr. Miles, for the defendants in error,    Mr. Miles, for the defendants in error, filed the following brief. corrections:  head_matter: James Stimpson, Plaintiff in error, v. The West Chester Railroad Company, Defendants. The practice of excepting, generaily, to a charge of the court to the jury, without   setting out, specifically, the points .excepted to, censured. The writ of error-not dismissed, only on account of the peculiar cireumst nces of the case. Where   defective patent had been surrendered, and a new one taken out, and the patentee brought an action for a vipiation of his patent right, laying the infringement at a date subsequent to that of the renewed patent, proof of the use of the thing patented during the interval between the original and renewed patents will not defeat the action. The seventh section of the act of March 3, 1839, has exclusive reference to an original application for a patent, and not to a renewal of it. An original patent being destroyed by the burning of the patent-office, and the only record of the specifications being a publication in the Franklin Journal, the claim is not limited by that publication, because the whole of the specifications are not set forth in it. Whether a renewed patent, after a surrender of a defective one, is substantially for a different invention, is a question for the jury, and not for the court. As the thirteenth section of the act of 1836 provides for the renewal of a patent, ' where it shall be   inoperative or' invalid by reason of a defective or insufficient description or specification,    iff the error shall have arisen by inadvertence, accident, or mistake, and without any fraudulent or deceptive intention,  the fact of the granting of the renewed patent closes all inquiry into the existence of inadvertence, accident, or mistake, and leaves open only the question of fraud for the jury. This case was brought up, by writ.of error, from the Circuit Court of the United States for East Pennslyvania. It was a suit brought, in the Circuit Court, by Stimpson against the Railroad Company, for a violation of his patent right. On the 23d of August, 1831, Stimpson took out letters patent for an improvement in the mode of turning short curves on railroads. These letters were not given in evidence upon the trial, having been burned in the conflagration of the patent-office, in December, 1836, and no copy could be found. Secondary evidence  was given of their contents by the following publication in the Franklin Journal.   JFor an improvement in the mode of turning short curves on railroads, such as the comers of streets   James Stimpson, city of Baltimore, August 23.  37. The plan proposed is to make the extreme edges of the flanches flat, and of greater width than ordinary, and to construct the rails in such a manner that where a short turn is to be made, the extreme edge of the flanch shall rest upon it, instead of upon the tread of the wheel, thus increasing the effective diameter of the wheel in a degree equal to twice the projection of the flanch. The claim is made to   the application of the flanches of railroad carriage-wheels to turn short curvatures upon railroads or tracks, particularly turning the corners of streets, wharves, crossing of tracks or roads, and passiug over turnabouts,  &c<  Fr nklin Journal, vol  9, p. 124. On turning to pages 270 and 271, vol. 4, there will be found specifications of two patenjs granted to James Wright, of Golumbia, Pennsylvania, for the mode of turning curves claimed by Mr. Stimpson. The only difference is, that Mr. Wright proposes to adapt his cars to several different curves by having three or more offsets in his wheels when necessary. On the same day, namely, the 23d of August, 1831, Stimpson took out, also, letters patent for an improvement in the mode of forming and'using cast or wrought-iron plates or rails, for railroad carriage-wheels to run upon. These letters being also destroyed, the following extract from the Franklin Journal was given in evidence. Franklin Journal, vol. 9, p. 125.    39. For an improvement in the mode of forming and using cast or wrought-iron plates, or rails, for. railroad carriage-wheels to run upon  James Stimpson, city of Baltimore, Maryland, August 23 (1831).   The claim in this case is to   the application of cast or wrought-iron plates for the use of railways on the streets or wharves of cities or elsewhere. The objects of said improvement being to employ rails that will not present any obstacles to the ordinary use of streets,  or sustain injury therefrom, and so to form the plates at the intersections of streets or other crossings, that cars will readily pass over them, and also on circles of small radius.     The rails are to be formed with a groove in them to receive the flanches of the wheels   on one side of the groove, the width is to be sufficient for tlm tread of the wheel, on the other, it need not exceed three quarters of an inch. These rails are .to be laid flush with the pavement of the streets. At corners to be turned, the rails are to be cast, or made of the proper curvature, one of them  only being provided with a groove,' as the flanch is to run upon the other, upon the principle described in No. 37. Provision is to be made by scrapers, or brushes, preceding the carriages, to clear the grooves of dust, ice, and other obstructions.  In 1835, the first mentioned of these letters, namely, for an    improvement in the mode of turning short curves on railroads,  were surrendered on account of a defective specification, and on the 26th of September, 1835, a renewed patent was issued for the term of fourteen years' from the 23d of August, 1831. The schedule referred to in this patent was as follows.    Short  Curves.  23d August, 1831.-  Renewed 26th September, ,1835.   To all whom these'presents shall come : Be it known, that I, James Stimpson, of the city and county of Baltimore and State of Maryland, have invented a new and useful improvement in the mode of turning short curves upon railroads with railroad carriages, particularly those round- the corners of streets, wharves, &c., and that the following is- a full and exact description of said invention or improvement, as invented or improved by me, namely :  I use or apply the common peripheries of the flanches. of the wheels for the aforesaid purpose, in the following manner : I lay a flat rail, which, however, may be grooved, if preferred, at the commencement of the curvation, and in a position t  be centrally under the flanches of the wheels upon the outer track of the circle, so. that no other part of the wheels which run upon the outer circle of the track rails shall  touch or bear upon the rails, but the peripheries of the flanches   they bearing tire whole weight of the load and carriage, while the opposite wheels, which run upon the inner track of the circle, are to be run and bear upon their treads in the usual way, and their flanches run freely in a groove or channel  which treads are ordinarily about thr e inches in diameter less than the peripheries of the flanches.  Were the bearing surfaces of the wheels which are in contact with the rails while thus turning the curve to be connected by straight lines from every point, there would thus be formed the frustrums of two cones (if there be four wheels and two axles to the carriage), or if but one axle and two wheels then but one cone   which frustrumsj or the weeels representing their extremities, will, if the wheels are thirty inches in diameter, and are coupled about three feet six inches apart, turn. a curve of about sixty feet radius of the inner track rail. The difference in diameter between the flanches and. treads before'stated, the'tracks of the usual width, and the wheels coupled as stated, would turn a curve of a somewhat smaller radius, if the axles were not confined to the carriage in a parallel position with each other   but this being generally deemed necessary, the wheels run upon lines of tangents, and these upon the inner track being as-wide apart in the coupling as the outer ones, keep constantly inclining the carriage outwards, and thus cause the carriage to tend to run upon a larger circle than the difference in diameter of the treads and flanches would otherwise give   but the depth of the flanches and the couplings may be so varied as to turn any other radius of a circle desired.   What I claim as my invention or improvement is the application of the flanches on the wheels on one side of railroad carriages, and of the treads of the wheels on the other side, to turn curves upon railways, particularly such as turning the corners of streets, wharves, &c., in cities and elsewhere, operating upon the principle herein set forth. JAMES STIMPSON.   Witnesses,   James H. Stimpson, George C. Penniman.  In October, 1840, Stimpson brought his action against the West Chester Railroad Company for a violation of this renewed patent, and laid the infringement to have taken place in 1839. In April, 1842, the case came on for trial. The plaintiff produced his patent, and gave evidence that the defendants had used upon their road several curves of this description. The defendants disputed the originality of the invention of the thing patented, under which head of defence much evidence was given   and also contended that the groove was not claimed in the first patent of 1831, and therefore was not included in the renewed patent of 1835. The evidence of Dr. Jones upon this last head being referred to by the court below, it is proper to insert that part of it.    interrogatory fifth. What are the contents of the specification of the alleged improvement of August 23, 1831 ? What are your means of knowing what were their contents ? If you know them, are they dissimilar or similar to those of the plaintiff s specification of September 26, 1835, a copy of which, marked A, is hereto annexed ? If dissimilar, state in what particulars, and whether they are as to matters of form and substance, and particularly describe the difference, if any. Answer fully.    To the fifth interrogatory, I answer, that the plaintiff exhibited to me the specification in question, previously to his filing the same in the Patent Office   as he likewise, did at the same 'time the specification of a patent for   forming and using cast-iron plates or rails for railroad carriage-wheels to run upon,  which last patent is noticed on page 125, vol. 9, se ond series, of the Journal of the Franklin Institute. ' I then examined them cursorily, and expressed an opinion, .that the improvements described in the two specifications might have been embraced in one, and that it would have been better to have pursued that course. The specific tion of the mode of turning short curves appeared to me incomplete   an essential feature of it being contained in that for   forming and using cast-iron plates,  &c. The papers, however, remained as drawn up by Mr. Stimpson s legal adviser, and when the patents were subsequently surrendered in 1835, it was thought best to preserve the division into two   it was probably in fact necessary to pursue this course, as I am not aware of any precedent for uniting two patents into one, although one may be divided into two . or more.    Nearly ten years have elapsed since I first saw the specifications upon which these patents were first issued, and nearly six years since I last read them   and my recollection of them  extends to certain prominent points only. The claim under the patent for turning short curves, as given in vol. 9, p. 124, of my Journal is, 1 have no doubt, literally correct. There has been an omission in the printing of inverted commas [  ] after the word   turnabout,  &c, In this specification it was proposed to make the extreme edges of the flanches flat,, and of greater width than, ordinary   this, however, did not enter into the claim, and it is not probable that I should have recollected the fact, had it not been noted in my Journal, or called up by some other collateral circumstance. The main-defect, in my judgment, of the original specification, in the patent for turning short curves, was the omission of the mention of the groove in the inner rail. I believe, however, that it was alluded to in this specification, but the description of it was contained principally, if not wholly, in the specification of the patent for 4 forming and using cast-iron on wrought plates,  &c., above noticed  as may be inferred from a reference to. my . Journal, vol. 9, p. 125, patent 39. 44 Cross Interrogatories. 1. Did you or did you not prepare th  papers of the plaintiff when his patent for short curves was surrendered and renewed ? Wh t was the object   of such surrender and renewal ? Was it or was it not that the claim of running over or across tracks at right angles might not continue any longer t  be incorporated in the same, patent with the claim* for short curves, as it had .been theretofore ? 44 To the first cross interrogatory, I answer, that I did prepare the papers of the plai itiff when his patent for turning short curves was surrendered lor reissue   that the object of such surrender and renewal was to limit and confine it to the turning short curves in streets, &c., by leaving out certain matters in it respecting, the crossing of tracks or roads, and the passing over turnabouts   and to define the subject-matter of the patent more clearly, without its being necessary to refer to that simultaneously obtained-for '4 forming and using cast or wrought-iron plates,  &c.  The bill of exceptions' taken by the plaintiff was to the following part of the charge of the court to the jury, namely:   44 Having thus presented you with a view of the rules and prin-' ciples of the common law applicable to the renewal of patents, as laid down by the Supreme Court, together with the provisions of. the different acts of Congress on this subject, we will now state to you what is, in our opinion, their legal result. 44 To authorize the surrender-of an old patent and issue of a new one, consistently with the provisions of the original patent law of 1793, and the decisions of the Supreme, Court, independently of any act of Congress conferring such power, there are these requisites indispensable to the power'arising. (1.) The original patent must be inoperative or invalid for the causes set forth' in the act of 1832,   the non-compliance with the third section of the act of 1793, for the want of a proper specification of the thing patented,. through inadvertence, accident, or mistake, without  ny fraudulent, or deceptive intention. This being the only case embraced in the law to which the authority conferred applies. (2.) 1, The defect in the specification, which- makes it incompetent to secure the rights of the patentee, must have arisen from inadvertence, aecident, or mistake, and 2, not from any fraud or misconduct. The reissue of the patent by the appropriate officer is presumptive evidence that the requisites of the law' have been complied with, on the production of such evidence or proof otherwise as justified it  but the question of the validity of the new patent is a judicial one, depending on the fact of inadvertence or fraud, as you shall find it  and the opinion of the court on matters of law involved in the inquiry. 14 Peters, 458   6 Peters, 243   7 Peters, 321   Act of. 1839 (5 Lit. & Brown s ed'. 353). The reason why there must be an inquiry into both the inadvertence and fraud arises from the settled construction of the act of 1793, that where the defect is not owing to fraud, the defendant is entitled to .a verdict and judgment in   his favor, but not. to a judgment that the patent is void for the defect, unless he shows that the defect was owing to' fraud. 1 Bald.   6 Peters, 246. You must then be satisfied, affirmatively, that the defect of the patent arose from the inadvertence of the patentee, and negatively, that it did not arise from his fraud or misconduct,' or, in the words of the acts of 1832 and 1836,   without any fraudulent or deceptive intention.  The finding the fact of inadvertence may negative the fact of fraud, but in this, as in other cases, fraud may be inferred from gross inadvertence or negligence, such as may be the indication of a design to deceive the public. The defects in the old patent must be in the specification, when it does not comply with the requisites of the third section of the act of 1793, calling for a correct description of the thing patented (6 Peters, 247)  a new one may be issued on compliance with those requisites, which are there prescribed.   But the new patent must be confined to the thing patented by the old one,  the thing invented or discovered,     the same invention    it cannot embrace another substantive and essential matter, which was not before patented   the thing, the invention, must be'the same in both patents   the only object in the renewal being to cure a defect in the description, not to supply the omission of an essential part of the invention   the new patent cannot .be broader than the old one. If the thing patented is the same in both patents, its public use did not, under the former laws, amount to an abandonment, or such an acquiescence as to affect the new patent on the ground of delay or negligence in the assertion of the right of the patentee, from the date of the old patent to its reissue. But when an essential part is. omitted, and the patentee suffers -it to remain unpatented till it has come into public use, before the new patent issues, it will be subject to the same rules which apply to an original patent, making it incompetent to protect the patentee in his claim to such part in virtue of the patent reissued, if it was not described in the one surrendered. The thirteenth section of the act of 1836 authorizes a new improvement, - invented since the first patent, to be added in a renewed one   no law gives- any authority to add an improvement, which had been invented by the patentee before the original grant  for it is not and cannot be any part of the description or .specification of another distinct improvement. A patent for the combination of the parts of an old machine must show wherein such combination exists   what parts compose it  how they are combined in their action   if the description is defective, it may be corrected by a new one   the correction, however, must not extend beyond the. combination of the parts first specified, as the introduction of other parts, not before specified, makes an entire new combination  consequently the thing patent d becomes essentially different, being not the same invention, but a new one, made by a combination of a pan. not combined before, which might be a proper subject of an original patent, yet would not be authorized in a renewed one.   These are the tests which the law applies to the description of the thing patented, in order to ascertain whether, in  the words of the act of 1832, the old patent was   invalid or inoperative   by reason that the condition's of the former law not- having been complied with, or, in the .language of the. Supreme Court, the patent   is found to be incompetent to secure the reward which the law intended to confer on the patentee for his invention.  -In such case, the patent may be surrendered for reissue, in order to correct the defects which invalidated the first, but the law expressly makes the new patent   in all respects liable to the same matter of objection and defence   as the old one, and imposes on the patentee the obligation   of compliance with the terms and conditions prescribed by the third section of the act of 1793.  This is done by showing, according to its requisitions, what was the invention, the thing patented, by a designation of the. invention prim cipally,, made in fuller-, clearer, and more exact terms than those used,' so as to give it validity and effect, and secure' the same invention, which is the only legitimate office of the renewed or reissued patent. A specification consists of two . parts,   description and claim   the descriptive part is the explanation of the improvement in all the particulars required by the law  the claim or summary, at the close.of the description or specification, is the declaration of the patentee of what he claims, as his invention, by which he is bound, so that he can claim nothing which is not included in the. summary, and could disclaim nothing which was included in-it till the passage of the act of 1837. But the summary  may be referred to the description, and both will be liberally construed to ascertain what was claimed, and if the words, will admit of it, both parts will.be connected in order to carry into effect the true intention of the patentee, as it may appear on a judicial inspection of the whole specification. This makes.it a question of law what is the thing patented, depending not on the actual or supposed intention of the patentee, but.the conclusion'of the law on the language he has used to express it  a part of the description may be construed as a claim, and carried into the summary, and made a part of the thing patented, the effect of which is the same as if it was included in the summary in express terms. Cooper v. Matheys, C. C. MSS. To authorize a recovery for the violation of a patent right, the plaintiff must show that he is the inventer of every thing he claims as new, that it is embraced in the patent, and that every thing so claimed and patented has been, infringed by the defendant  thus, where the patent is for a particular combination of the parts of an old machine, and the defendant has not used the whole combination as specified in the description, and carried into the summary, the plaintiff cannot recover. Prouty et al. v. Ruggles, 16 Peters, 336,  The court then proceeded to state the substance of the plaintiff s' declaration, and referred to the patent of 1835, and the specification thereto attached, in order to ascertain the thing patented by that patent which was stated therefrom   they then inquired what was the thing patented in 1831, by referring to the evidence of Thomas P. Jones, contained in the deposition  foresaid,. in connection with the Journal of the Franklin Institute referred to by him. The court, remarking that there being in evidence no copy of the patent of 1831, any drawing or specification of the thing patented, or other pfoof of the contents of either than was contained in the deposition and Journal aforesaid, then gave their opinion to the jury,, that, on this evidence, the use of grooves was not-claimed, and was no part of the thing patented in 1831 for turning shoft curves, but was a part of the thing patented in 1835. That it was an essential part of this invention, as Jones testified, and without which all the witnesses agreed that the invention was useless   as without the groove the cars would run off the road, and that the patent was not for any parts of the machine which were new, but for a new combination of the old parts. It was th n submitted to the jury, whether, on the evidence aforesaid, the omission of the groove in the patent of 1831 arose from inadvertence, and if it was done contrary to the advice of Jones, and in conformity with the opinion of the legal adviser of the plaintiff, and whether, without the groove, the description of the thing patented .was sufficient, under the third section of the act of. 1793, which was read and commented on by the court, who then proceeded as follows.   The Secretary of State is a ministerial officer, who must issue a patent if the requisites are performed. 6 Peters, 241. The question of inadvertence or mistake is a judicial one, which the Secretary cannot decide, nor those judicial questions on which the validity of the patent depends. He issues the patent without inquiry. The correct performance of all the preliminaries to the validity of the original patent are. always examinable in the court where the fact is brought. 6 Peters, 242, 6, 47. 44 In the application of the law to   the evidence before you, the first inquiry is into the state of facts existing at the time of grant-ing the patent of 1835   did they present a case for renewal, under the rules of law. on which we have given you our instructions ? Whether the original patent was invalid or inoperative is more a question of law than fact, to be  scertained on a judicial inspection of the patent, specification, drawings, models, and the evidence of the contents   the court must construe all written evidence   but as depositions are considered merely as oral testimony, a jury must decide what parts are proved by them. The court must take as true the statements of witnesses as they are made, and lay down the, law on the assumption of their credibility, and both court and E  ry must take an agreed or admitted uncontested state of facts to !  their rule of action   a jury may deem,   witness unworthy of credit, oir not believe his statement, but ought to do neither without good cause. Whether the defects in the old patent arose from inadvertence or otherwise is. also a mixed question of law and fact,   of law so far as depends on written, and of fact-as to parol evidence   on this subject you have the evidence of Dr. Jones, who officially examined die old patent, &c., and made out die new, and we are mainly left to ascertain the facts in relation to both patents from him. In laying down the law to you, we assume his verity in all'he'says, and, taking his statement as proof of the facts there existing, our opinion is,  that, connected with the publication in the Journal of the Franklin Institute, in 1832, when the matter was fresh in his recollection, and the specification in the new patent, the old one was invalid and inoperative, by reason of noncompliance with the requisites of the act of 1793. That it did not embrace the groove-, which was essential to its validity, that the new patent'is not for the same invention, and that the plaintiff has not made out a case of such inadvertence, accident, or mistake as justified the issue of the new patent, inasmuch as it appears from .the patent for plates oh railroads, issued at the same time with the one for short curves, that he had known and described the grooves. 44 It is for you to say, whether you will take this evidence as we do   if you discredit it, in whole or in .part, you will find according^- . ..... . ..... 44 Another important question arises m this case, on the construction of the seventh section of the act of 1839, taken in connection with former laws, which is, whether the plaintiff can sustain an action for the use of his invention, in the construction of his curvesj before the granting of the patent of 1835. 44 This section provides,  4 That every person or corporation who has, or shall have, purchased or constructed any newly invented machine, manufacture, or composition of matter, prior to the application by the inventer or discoverer for a patent* shall be held to possess the right to use, and vend to others to be used, the specific machine, manufacture, or composition so made or'purchased,. without liability therefor to the .inventer, or any other person interested in such invention   and no patent shall be held to be invalid by reason of such purchase, sale, or use prior to the application for a patent as aforesaid, except on proof of abandonment of such invention to the public, or that such purbhase, sale, or prior use has been for more than two years prior to such application for a patent.    Though this act is retrospective in its effects on then existing patents, it is not void on that account  it was within the constitutional power of Congress to enact it as a rule for all cases, to which its words and intentions apply, by its fair- and legal interpretation, which we must ascertain by looking at the old law   the mischief and the remedy, which must be traced through the decisions of the Supreme Court  and. the acts of Congress on the same subject.   In 1808, an act was granted to Oliver Evans renewing his patent, which, had expired by its' own limitation   in the interval, the defendant had constructed a machine of his invention, and continued to use it  after the new patent issued, he was held liable, according to the words of the law, for such subsequent use, but the Supreme. Court thus express their opinion of the case, had it rested on general principles:    The legislature might have proceeded still further, by providing a shield for persons standing in the situation of these defendants   it is believed that the reasonableness of such a. provision could have been questioned by no one, &c., &c. The argument, founded on the hardship of'this and similar cases, would be entitled to great weight, if the.words of this proviso were obscure and open to construction.  Evans a. Jordan, 9 Cranch, 203.    A-nd thereupon the counsel for the plaintiff did then and there .except to the aforesaid charge and opinion of the said court. The above not being enough of the charge of the court below to the jury, the counsel for the plaintiff in error applied for and obtained a writ of certiorari to bring up additional extracts. The return was as follows. On searching the record and proceedings of the Circuit Court of the United States,- in and for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, in the third circ it, in a certain cause therein lately depending between James Stimpsbn, plaintiff, and the West Chester Railroad Company, defendants,, we find the following omission in the charge of the judge to the jury, which, in obedience to the annexed writ of certiorari, is hereby certified, to wit:  r -    In Morris v. Huntington, Judge Thompson held, that after a patent was surrendered, the inverition would be open to public use without hazard, so far as depends on such patent. 1 Paine, 355. In Grant v. Raymond, the court notice'the case of the use of the invention between the date of the old and before the new patent, but remark, that that defence.is not made   and the Circuit Court did not say that such defence would not he successful  and they add,  The defence, when true in fact, may be sufficient in law, notwithstanding the validity of the new patent.  6 Peters, 244. The court, in this and the subsequent case of Shaw v. Cooper, held, that the new patent was a continuation of the old, but gave no opinion on the question, whether damages could be recov red for the intermediate use of   machine constructed after the first.   This question was, however, put at rest by the last clause of the act of 1832, which, assuming that damages could not be recovered for a use of the patented invention, before the hew patent, provides :  4 But no public use or privilege of the invention so patented, derived from or after the grant of the original patent, either under any special license of the inventer, or without the consent of the patentee that there shall be a free public use thereof, shall in any manner prejudice his right of recovery for any use or violation of his invention, after the grant of such new patent as aforesaid.  The act of 1836 is still more explicit, by providing for the right of recovering damages only for   causes subsequently accruing.   f  It thus appears, that the act of 1839 goes only one step be-1 yond those of 1832 and 1836, and is a dead letter, if it protects the person who-has purchased, constructed, or used the machine invented by the patentee no farther than from damages accruing prior to the new patent, for the same protecti n is given by those laws.    To.have any effect, it must be held to be, in the words of the Supreme Court,   a shield,  which covers the party from all liability, and by so construing it, the act of 1839 embodies the very principle, and none other, which, in Evans v. Jordan, 9 Cranch, 203, that court declared to be one which they believed that no one could question its reasonableness, in order to prevent the hardship of a case precisely similar in principle to that presented. Such construction is the more reasonable, when it is considered that the protection is confined to the specific machine used before the patent, and cannot be extended to protect the use of any new or other machine, or construed to invalidate the patent, or justify the subsequent use by any other persons than those so protected.    That such , was the intention of Congress in relation to an original patent cannot be doubted, and we can perceive no reason why they should omit the very case on which the Supreme Court had so explicitly declared their opinions, if the words of the act of 1808 would have permitted them to apply ,an unquestionable principle. The act of 1839 not only does n t exclude its applicaeation, but authorizes and requires it. In referring to the application for a patent, it was evidently intended to apply it to the patent on which the patentee sought to recover, the renewed one, on which alone his right rested, for the law. cannot be presumed to be intended to apply to a patent which, being invalid or inoperative, as a ground of action, had been, surrendered, cancelled, and cancelled by the act of the patentee himself, and was thus divested of all intrinsic efficiency by the acts of 1832 and 1836. Jt could have no effect without the aid of the new one, and it would be absurd to suppose that the law overlooked the application .for the only effective patent, and looked only to that which derived new life from it  besides, the act of 1839 would take from a defendant the protection of the acts of 1832 and 1836, by confining its operation to the old parent, for damages could then be recoverable for the use between the date and the renewal,   a conclusion wholly inadmissible on a sound construction of either the acts in question.   The act of 1832 expressly declares that the new patent shall be subject in all respects to the same matters of objection and defence as the original one   from which it necessarily follows, that if the purchase or construction, of a machine, before the application for an original patent, would protect a defendant from all liability to the patentee, the same defence is available when applied to the new one.   This view of the act of 1839 suffices for the purposes of the present case   a'broader one has been taken of it, in all its bearings, in another district in this circuit, which it is not now necessary to examine to decide the point now under consideration.   In the case before us, it clearly appears that the defendants constructed their railroad with the plaintiff s curves in 1834, one year or more befot e the plaintiff s application for his renewed patent  consequently they may continue its use without liability to-the plaintiff.  The case was argued by Mr. J. R. Ingersoll and Mr. J. R. Ingersoll, for the plaintiff in error, and Mr. Miles, for the defendants in error, The brief of the counsel on the part of the plaintiff in error was as follows. This case comes up for argument upon a bill of exceptions taken by the plaintiff, to the charge of the learned judge in the court below, by which, in effect, the jury were directed to find for the defendants, which they accordingly did. The plaintiff took a patent, the 23d of August, 1831, for an invention or improvement in the application of the dandies of the wheels on one side of railroad carriages, and of the treads of the wheels on the other side, to- turn short curves upon railroads. It was surrendered in consequence of a defect in the specification, and a new patent taken by him the 26th of September, 1835.   The object of such surrender and renewal (see deposition of Dr. Thomas P. Jones, a witness for the defendant, in answer to the first cross interrogatory, ante, p. 384) was to limit and confine it to the turning short curves in streets, &c., by leaving out certain matters in it respecting the crossing of tracks or roads, and the passing over turnabouts, and to define the subject-matter of the patent more clearly, without its being necessary to refer to that simultaneously* obtained- for forming and using cast or wrought-iron plates, &c.  The action was brought at the October session, 1840. The curves used by the defendants were said to have been constructed and first used by them between the dates of the first and second patents, the use being continued by them since the date of the second patent. The learned judge, after considering at length the law touching this part of the c se, said to the jury :     It clearly appears that the defendants constructed their railroad with the plaintiff s curves in 1834, one year or more, before the plaintiff s application for his renewed patent  consequently, they   may continue its use without liability to the plaintiff. -  In Grant v. Raymond, 6 Peters, 244, the defendant made it .a' question, whether the patentee who took an amended patent could recover damages for the defendant s use, subsequent to the amendment of the patent, of machinery which had been constructed prior to the amendment. The court did not decide the point, thinking it did not come directly up for decision. But they said of it,     This objection is more formidable in appearance than in reality. It is not probable that the defect in the specification can be so apparent as to be perceived by any but those who examined it for the purpose of pirating the invention.  Grant v. Raymond was decided early in 1832. On the. 3d of July, 1832, was passed (4 Lit. & Brown s ed. 559) the first act by which the amendment of patents for defective specifications was statutorily recognized. The third section of the act contains a proviso, that the new patent shall be open to all objections which existed against the old one, by virtue of which, if the phrase stood al ne, a defendant, in this case, for example, might say, I used your curves before 1835,   before the date of your patent,   that is, between the new patent and the old one, and as a use by the public prior to the date of the patent would be fatal as against the old patent, so it is against the new. Now to meet such an argument, the same proviso goes on to say, that no use of the patented invention between the dates of the first and second patents, excepting under a surrender of the invention to public use, shall prejudice the patentee s right to recover damages   for any use    after the grant of the new patent. We quote at length the proviso of the-third section.     Provided however, That such new patent so gtant d 'shall, in all respects, be liable to the same matters of objection and defence as any original patent granted under the said first-mentioned act.   But no public use bf privilege of the invention so patented, derived from or after the grant of the original, either under tny special license of the inventer, or without the consent of the-patentee that there shall be a free public use thereof, shall, in any manner, prejudice his right of recovery for any use or violation of his. .invention after the grant of such new patent as aforesaid.  It is submitted, that, by the terms of this statute, to use, after the date of the second patent, the patented machinery, even though the specific machine used had been constructed and used between the dates of the first and second patents, is expressly denied to the public. On the faith of this statute of the 3d July, 1332, the plaintiff, in September, 1835, surrendered the patent granted him the 23d August, 1831, and took an amended one. Has any act of Congress changed the law in this particular since 1832 ?. As any such law, so far as regards', -his plaintiff, would be retroactive,. it ought to be clearly expressed. On the 6 th of July, 1836, was passed the new patent act, by which the whole system was recast, but the thirteenth section, which relates to amended patents, says in broad terms :      And the patent so reissued, together with the corrected description and specification, shall have the same effect and operation in law, on.the trial of all actions hereafter commenced, for causes subsequently accruing, as though the same had been originally filed in such corrected form before the issuing of the original patent.  It is submitted that the words,   for causes subsequently accruing,  are not to be ^trained from their natural construction, in order to be made to retroact against the rights already vested under the protection of a statute   and that the cause of action against these defendants, as far as concerns their use of the patented invention since the 26th of September, 1835, is a cause subsequently accruing, within the just and obvious meaning bf the act. In 1837, the 3d of March, was passed an amendment to the law of 1836. The plaintiff submits that the seventh and ninth sections of - the act of 1837 bear on. his case, by analogy. . They permit a patentee who has patented too much, and more than he invented, to make disclaimer of the excess, with the same effect, as regards the validity of the patent, as if his disclaimer were part of his original specification. That is to say, the patentee shall recover as if his patent had been originally right instead of wrong   and no exception is made in favor of parties who, like the defendants here, use. after disclaimer, one of the patented things, which they had com structed and begun, to use while the patent was too broad  the legislature being influenced, perhaps, by the suggestion of this court in Grant ii. Raymond, that that party is not entitled to much favor, who scans a specification in order to pirat   it. On the 3d of March, 1839, the latest amendment of the patent laws was passed. The seventh section of this aht is cited by the learned judge, who asks-, what this section means, if it do not mean that the use of a patented machine shall be free to a defendant after the patent, if he constructed it before. It reads thus :     Sect. 7. And be it further enacted,' That every person or corporation who has, or shall have, purchased or constructed any newly invented machine, manufacture, -or composition of matter, prior to the application by the inventer or discoverer for a patent, shall be held to possess the right to use, and to vend to others to be used, the specific machine, manufacture, or composition of matter so made or. purchased, without liability therefor to the inventer, or any other person interested in such invention   and no patent shall be held to be invalid by reason of such purchase,-sale, or use, prior to the application for a patent as aforesaid, except on proof of abandonment of such invention to the public, or that such purchase, sale, or prior use has been for more than two years prior-to such application for a patent.  It is admitted, in answer to the learned judge, that the seventh section of the act of 1839 was intended to protect defendants, constructed of machinery prior to the patent, in the use of such machinery after the grant to the patentee. This section, which has no reference to renewed or amended, more than to all other, patents, is believed to provide for a case, till 1839 unprovided for   namely, the case in general, whether it arise under an original patent, or under one which has been amended, or which has been modified by disclaimer of the use by a defendant, after the issuing of the letters, of a machine such as .they patent, but which specific machine was purchased or constructed before their date. But it is respectfully submitted, that this prior use meant a use prior to the firs , or original application of the inventer for his- patent, and that th ? legislature had not in their   contemplation the second application of the inventer, when they used the words   prior to the application of the inventer or discoverer for a patent.  The last clause of the section ha? obvious reference to the original application alone, when it is declared-that   such purchase, sale, or use, prior to the application for a patent,  shall not (except under certain circumstances) -make the patent invalid   for it was clear already, and quite independently of this statute, that no renewed or amended patent pould be worth paying for, if the use of the patented machinery by third persons, prior to the renewal, could make.it invalid. Grant v. Raymond, however, furnishes the best answer to the learned judge s position, that die .plaintiff s patent is liable to be damaged by what has taken place since the date of the original letters. At page '244 (6 Peters) ,- the court says :    { It has also been argued, That the new patent must issue on the new specification, and on the application which accompanies it. .Consequently, it will not be true that the machine was   not known or used before the application.  But the new patent, and the proceedings on which it issues', have relation to the original transaction. The time of the privilege still runs from the date of the original patent. The application may be considered as appended to the original application.  The plaintiff in error contends, that a true interpretation of the letter of these several acts, and a due regard to the spirit of all recent legislation on the subject of patent-rights, which has been kind- and liberal towards patentees, enforce the conclusion, that it was meant, when the new patent was granted, to give to the new, in all particulars, the charter of the old, unless when restrained by express words to narrower limits. And further, that while, for obvious, reasons, the acts deny to the patentee a right to recover damages, under the new patent, for a use of the invention of earlier date than the patent itself (which denial is in terms), no express words of the-statutes, or fair or.necessary implication from them, or leaning, cari be found, in the whole course of the legislation since 1832, to warrant the conclusion that the new patent does not confer upon the grantee an entire monopoly of the fruits of his invention, from the date of the second letters to the expiration of the fourteen years from the date of the first. The plaintiff in error therefore assigns for error the learned judge s instructions to the jury,' recognizing the defendants  right to use the patented invention, after the date of the second patent, provided they had commenced its use prior to that date, and continued after that .date to use only the specific machine at first used. The learned judge also charged the whole case to be against the plaintiff upon another question, namely, that of the description of the    groove,  in the original patent. The judge was of opini n that the groove was not in the first .patent, and was in the second j and therefore that the second was broader than the first, and not confined to the thing there patented, and thus was' defective as an amended patent. The plaintiff s patent being, as he supposed, established fully, by .judicial sanction of the highest sort, in his contest with the Trenton Railroad Company, reported in 14 Peters, 448, had not even, brought with him, when he came to try his cause in Philadelphia, the original letters patent, and the drawings which accompanied them. Nor was any notice given him by'the defendant to produce them. The result of his suit against the Baltimore and Susquehaima Railroad Company, tried in the Maryland District, in April term, 1843, when both the original patent and the drawings were produced in court, proved to be quite ill founded the attempt of the defendants, in the present case, to criticise his second patent as actually varying from the first, by the addition of this new matter, the groove. He is aware, however, that he must sustain his case as it appears, by this record, and he proceeds to do so. The whole invention of the plaintiff consisted of a new method of attaining conical action in turning short curves on railroads. And the groove had no more to do with it than this:  that when, to attain t as action the outer wheel was mounted upon its flanch, the groove, by receiving the inner wheel, prevented the car from slipping off the track   a very material consideration, it is true   in turning the comer   and so was the car, or the steam-engine that drew the car  but neither of them had any thing to do with the plaintiff s method of producing conical action. Without a groove* just as without steam, a horse, or other power, the comer could not be turned  and therefore, in describing the plaintiff s invention, both this power and the groove must needs be referred, to   but it is respectfully denied, that more than the merest allusion to either is necessary, neither of them being any part of the invention, nor so occult as to demand, for even the most unenlightened observer, more than a mere allusion to it. Now it was in proof from the witness called by the defendant to testify to the contents of the.original'specification, that it alluded to the groove.   I believe, however, that it (the groove) was alluded to in this specification.    Evidence of Dh. Jones. This allusion to the groove, in the first patent, the learned judge rules, in his charge, to be insufficient, and in the paragraph ante, pp. 387, 388, after so holding, he goes on to declare, that the groove should have been   claimed.  It may be mentioned that it is not claimed in the new patent, nor even alluded to in the summary of the specification   so collateral is it to the invention. The plaintiff in error further assigns for error, in this portion of the charge touching the groove, the learned judge s decision against tlie plaintiff s right to claim under his patent, because of his alleged omission in regard to the groove   and particularly to the judge s saying, that, assuming the truth of Dr. Jones s deposition, the opinion of.the court was, that the old patent was  invalid and inoperative, by reason of noncompliance with the requisition of the act of 1793. That it did not embrace the groove, which was essential to its validity  that the new patent is not for the same invention.  Also, the learned judge s taking from the jury the question, which came fairly up as a question of fact, namely, whether this mention of, or allusion to, the groove was or was not too slight a description of that part of the combination to enable one skilled as an engineer to make a curve, or to stand for a compliance, by the patentee, with the requisition of the statute touching the proper description of the invention'. Also, the learned judge s deciding it to be a matter of. law,-and not of fact for the jury, what'the thing patented in 1831 was, when the evidence of what it was lay not in a written paper, which the judge could read and construe, but in parol evidence, and explanations per testes. Also, the learned judge s not giving the due legal- effect to the secretary s seal and letters patent, as prima, facie evidence that the second patent legitimately succeeded to the first, and to his assuming, on the contrary, that it was incumbent on the plaintiff, and not on the defendant (who assailed it), to show what the first patent contained, and .what its character and defects were, and in the absence of the patent, and of any notice or call for it by the defendant, and in the absence of any satisfactory account of its contents to the learned judge, making the plaintiff, and not the defendant, responsible for the imperfectness of the proofs regarding the same. The judge left nothing to the jury, as distinctly appears in his summing up, in regard to the groove (ante, p. 388), but the question whether Dr.. Jones s testimony was to be believed or not. If believed, he told the jury they must find for the defendants, the old patent being defective, in not embracing the groove, and the new patent, which he said did embrace it, being therefore for a different invention altogether.   The plaintiff in error also assigns it for .error, that the learned judge ruled   mistake,  in the statute about amending patents, to mean inadvertence or accident only, and excluded cases of honest mistakes of judgment. Mr. Miles, for the defendants in error, filed the following brief. Abstract of Case: 1. This is a writ of error to the Circuit Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. The plaintiff in the Circuit Court is the plaintiff in error in this court. The verdict in the Circuit Court was for the defendants. 2. The action was brought to recover damages for an alleged infringement by the defendants of an exclusive right,.alleged to belong to the plaintiff, to make, use, construct, and vend an improvement   in the mode of turning short curves on railroads,  of which he claimed to be the original inventer, and alleged to have been secured to him by letters patent of the United States, according to the acts of Congress. The plaintiff claimed under letters patent, dated September 26th, 1835, which recited that letters for the same improvement were granted to him on August 23d, 1831, but which were  hereby cancelled on account of a defective specification.  3. The plaintiff declared on the letters patent of September 26th, 1835, in four counts (only varying in the allegation of different, modes of infringement, namely, making, constructing, selling, and using), all setting forth that   the said letters patent (that is, of August 23d, 1831) were cancelled in due form of law, on account of a defective specification.  4. The defendants pleaded not guilty, gave due notice to the plaintiff, under the acts of Congress, of a defence based upon the want of originality of invention of the thing patented on the part of the plaintiff, under the several patents of 1831 and 1835, said notice including the prior use and knowledge of other persons, and of prior printed and published descriptions of the same, &c., and under such plea and notice gave evidence to the jury. The original letters of the 23d of August, 1831, were not in evidence, they having been destroyed in the conflagration of the patent-office in December, 1836, nor was there any copy of them given in evidence. Their loss or destruction havjng been proved, secondary evidence was given of their contents.- (Journal Franklin Institute, vol. 9, p. 124, No. 37   and by deposition of Dr. Thomas P. Jones.) The claim, by this evidence, under .the patent of 1831, was  to the -application of the flapches of railroad carriage-wheels to turn, short curvatures upon railroads or tracks, particularly turning the corners of streets, wharves, crossing of tracks or r ads, and passing over turnabouts,  &c. No mention was made therein of the use of a groove upon the inner circl  for the flanch to run in, so as to enable the wheel on the inner circle to run on its tread, without which there was evidence. tending to' show that , the whole alleged invention was useless. The claim under the patent of 4835 was to   the application of the flanches of-the wheels on one side of railroad-carriages, and of the treads of the wheels on the other side, to turn curves upon railways,  -&c.,  operating upon the principles herein set forth.  The specification referred to in this summary describes the use of the flanch running on the surface of the outer rail, and of the tread running on the inner rail, winch is formed with a groove to receive the flanch of the wheel on the inner rail, as the. essential parts, which, combined together, form the improvement. 5. Upon the trial, several questions of law and of fact arose. His honor, Mr. Justice Baldwin, charged the jury upon the law, and left the facts falling within the scope of the principles of the law, as laid down by him, to the determination of the jury. Points of Law arising under the Charge contended for by Defendants. The third section of the act of 21st February, 1793, in substance, provides that the applicant for a patent shall give a description, in full, clear, and exact terms, of the thing invented, and its modes of application. By the sixth section of the same act, a defendant in a suit brought on letters patent may show that the description (that is, specification) does not contain the whole truth relative to his discovery, or that it contains more than is necessary, to produce the desired effect, which concealment or addition shall fully appear to have been made for the purpose of deceiving the public, or that the thing secured by patent was not originally discovered by the patentee, &c. The third section of the act of July 3, 1832, provides, in substance, that if any patent shall be invalid or inoperative by reason of noncompliance with the terms of the third section of ..the act of 1793, by  inadvertence, accident, or mistake,  and   without any .fraudulent or deceptive intention,  it may be lawful for the Secretary of State, on surrender of the original patent, to grant a new patent, on compliance with the conditions of the third section of the act of 1793, for the residue of the term unexpired. The thirteenth and fifteenth sections of the act of 4th July, 1836, which supplied the former laws enacted on the subject, contain in substance the same' provisions as to the inoperation of a patent by reason of the defective description, and  allowing a surrender and regr nt, where the defect arose from  inadvertency, accident, or mistake, and without any fraudulent or deceptive .intention.  The seventh section of the act of March 3, 1839, provides,   that every person or corporation who has, or shall have, purchased or constructed any newly invented machine, &c., prior to the application by the inventer, &c., for a patent,  may use and vend it at all times, without liability to the inventer or any person, &c. Under these acts, the following points are submitted to have been judicially decided. 1. That where a'patentee, under the act of February 21st, 1793, has not complied with the terms of its third section, even through .in dvertence, accident, or mistake, the plaintiff cannot recover for an infringement prior to a surrender and new grant. Grant v. Raymond, 6 Peters, 244   Shaw v. Cooper, 7 Peters, 320   Whitney v. Emmett, 1 Bald. 303. , 2. That if the patentee under the act of 1793 has not complied with the terms of its third section, through fraudulent and deceptive intention, by concealment of or addition to his real discovery, his .patent, by the sixth section, is absolutely void. Grant v. Raymond, 8 Peters, 246, 247   Whitriey v. Emmett 1 Bald. 303. 3. (1.) That a surrender under the acf sn 1832 and a new grant are only sustainable where the defect in the description of the first patent was* the result of inadvertence, accident, or mistake. Grant v. Raymond, 6 Peters, 246, 247. (2.) That a new grant, on such a surrender, is hot sustainable, but is absolutely void,  f it appear that the defect in the description of the first patent, wh thtv of concealment or addition, was the result of a fraudulent and deceptive intention on the part of the patentee. (3.) That if a patentee surrendered his first patent, and, under pretence of an inadvertence, accident, or mistake in its description, obtained a new patent, adding thereto a new material or element of which he was not the original inventer., and which is necessary to make the thing patented useful, thus in die second patent specifying another combination, constit ting a mode or machine substantially different from that described and claimed in the first,'it is fraud in the patentee, and the patent is void. Grant v. Raymond, 6 Peters, 218, 244   Philadelphia Railroad v. Stimpson, 14 Peters, 462   Shaw v. Cooper, 7 Peters, 292. Note. The act of-1832 (July 3d), authorizing a surrender and regrant, shortly followed the decision in Grant v. Raymond, 6 Peters (January, term, 1832), and by express enactment provided for that which had before been allowed by practice and judicial con-. struction only. 4. That an original patent, as well as that granted on .a surrender of.the first under these acts, are prima facie evidence only of the*  novelty and utility of the alleged invention, and of the compliance by the patentee with the terms of the several acts of Congress entitling him to. a patent  but their validity is 'examinable in a judicial proceeding upon any such patent, part of the inquiry being within the province of the court where'the.construction of written documents is to be made, and part being for the determination of ' the jury where questions of fact are involved. Grant v. Raymond, 6 Peters, 218   Shaw v. Cooper, 7 Peters, 292   Philadelphia Railroad v. Stimpson, 14 Peters, 448   Prouty v. Ruggles, 16 Peters, 336. 6. If a patentee s first patent be inoperative for want of a full, and exact description, and' he stands by for a long and unreasonable period of time, without surrendering and remedying the defect by furnishing sucli a description, and obtaining a regrant,'and in the mean time permits others to use what he subsequently claims to be his invention, with   knowledge of such use without objection or asserting his right, this is evidence from which a jury may infer his acquiescence and abandonment to the public as a matter of fact. Shaw v. Cooper, 7 Peters, 320   322. 6. Under the act of 1839, if the defendants purchased or con- ' structed this mode of turning curves, before the application for the patent of 1835, and this combination or mode described in that. patent was newly invented by the patentee, the plaintiff cannot recover, notwithstanding the act of 1839 was subsequent to the dates of such purchase or construction, and the patent of 1835. Shaw v. Cooper, 7 Peters, 320 - 322   McClurg v. Kingsland, 1 Howard, 204   Evans v. Jordan, 9 Cranch, 201. . jfote 1. This statute was intended to provide expressly and in terms (designating a specific point of time) for all that class of cases of implied acquiescence and waiver in favor of the public resulting from the negligence of the patentee, by which judicial construction held that the patentee had no claim against per-. sons using or constructing the alleged invention under such circumstances. JVote 2. This action was brought in the Circuit Court after the passage'of the act of 1839, to wit, at the October session, 1840. The charge of the court left all the facts falling within the scope of the legal principles therein stated to the determination of the jury.. < 1.   The question of the validity of the new patent is a judicial one, depending on the fact of inadvertence or fraud, as you shall find it.    You must then be satisfied affirmatively,  &c.   The finding of the fact of inadvertence may negative the fact of fraud,  &c. 2.   It was then submitted to the jury,, whether, on the evidence aforesaid, the omission in the patent of 1831 arose from inadvertence,  &c. 3.   Depositions are considered merely as oral testimony  a jury . must decide what facts are proved by them, ...... a mixed question of law and fact  of law so far as depends on written, and of fact as to parol evidence,  &c. . 4.   It is for you to say, whether you will take the evidence as we do   if you discredit it, in whole or in part, you will find accordingly.  .\n",
      "Choice 2:\n",
      "judges:   parties:  The Philadelphia and Trenton Railroad Company, Plaintiffs in error, vs. James Stimpson, Defendant in error. opinions:  Mr. Justice Story delivered the opinion of the Court. This is a writ of error to the judgment of the Circuit Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, rendered in an action brought by Stimpson, the defendant in error, against the plaintiffs in error, for a violation of a patent right granted to him for a new and useful improvement in the mode of turning short curves on railroads. A patent was originally granted to Stimpson, for the same invention, on the 23d day of August, 1831  and the renewed patent, upon which the present suit is brought, was granted on the 26th of September, 1835, upon the former letters patent   being cancelled on account of a defective specification   and the renewed patent was for the term of fourteen years from the date of the original. patent. With the exception of'the recital of the fact that the former letters patent were cancelled  on account of a defective specification,  and the statement of the-prior date from which the renewed patent was to begin to run, the renewed patent is in the precise form in which original patents are granted. At the trial upon the general issue, a bill of exceptions was taken to certain rulings of the Court upon points of evidence, to the consideration of which we shall at once proceed without any further preface. The first exception taken is to the admission of the renewed patent as evidence in the cause to the jury. The patent act of 1832, ch. 162, sec. 3,  under which this patent was obtained, provides, that whenever any patent shall be inoperative or invalid, by reason that any of the terms or conditions prescribed by the prior acts of Congress, have not, by inadvertence, accident, or mistake, and without any fraudulent or deceptive intention, been complied with on the part of the inventor, it shall be lawful for the Secretary of State, upon the surrender to him of such-patent., to cause a new patent to be granted to the inventor, for the- same invention, for the residue of the period then unexpired for which the original patent was granted, upon his compliance with the -terms and conditions prescribed by the third section of the act of the 21st of February, 1793, ch. 55. Now, the objection is, that the present patent does not contain any recitals that the prerequisites thus stated in the act have been complied with, viz. that the error in the former patent has arisen by inadvertency, accident, or mistake, and without any fraudulent or deceptive intention  and that without s ch recitals, as it is the case of a special authority, the patent is a mere nullity, and inoperative. .We are of opinion that the objection cannot, in point of law, be maintained. The patent was issued under the great seal of the United States, and is signed by the President, and countersigned by the Secretary of State. It is a presumption of law, that all public officers, and especially such high functionaries, perform their proper official duties until the contrary is proved. And where, as in the present case, an act is to be done, or patent granted upon evidence and proofs'to be laid before a public officer, upon which he is to decide, the fact that he has done the act or granted the patent, is prima facie evidence that the proofs have been regularly made, and were satisfactory. No other tribunal is at liberty to re-examine or controvert the sufficiency of such proofs, if laid before him, when the law has made such officer the proper judge of their sufficiency and competency. It is not, then, necessary for the patent to contain any recitals that the prerequisites to the grant of it have been duly complied with, for the law makes the presumption  and- if, indeed, it were otherwise, the recitals would not help the case without th auxiliary proof that these prerequisites had been, de facto, complied with. This has been the uniform construction, as far as we know in ali our Courts of justice upon matters of this sort. Patents for l nds, equally with patents for inventions, have been deemed prima facie' evidence that they were regularly granted, whenever they have'been produced under the great seal of the government  without any recitals or proofs that the- prerequisites of the acts under which they have been issued have been duly observed. In cases of patents, the Courts of the United States have gone one step further, and as the patentee is required to make oath that he is the true inventor, before he can obtain a patent, the patent has been deemed prima facie evidence that he has made the invention. This objection, then, is overruled  and there was no error in the Circuit Court in the admission of the patent. The next exception is to. the refusal of the Court to allow a witness, Josiah White, to give a description of an invention which he had seen on the Mauch Chunk railroad, in 1S27, which had a groove on one side, and run on the other on a flange for crossing, for the purpose of showing that the supposed invention of the plaintiff was known and in use by others, before the date of his patent. By the patent act of 1836, (which was applicable to the present point,) it is provided in the fifteenth section,- that whenever the defendant relies in his defence on the fact of a previous invention, knowledge, or- use of the thing patented, he shall state in his notice of special matter to be used in his defence, the names and places of residence of those, whom he intends to prove to have possessed -a prior knowledge of the thing, and where the same had been used. The object of this most salutary provision is to prevent patentees being surprised at the trial of the cause, by evidence of a nature which they could not be presumed to know, or be prepared to meet, and thereby to subject them either to most expensive delays, or to a loss of their cause. It is incumbent on those who seek to show that the examination of a witness has been improperly rejected, to establish their right to have the evidence admitted  for the Court will be presumed to have acted correctly, until the contrarv is established. In the present case, there is no proof on the record that notice had been given according to the requirements of the statute, that White was to be a witness for the purpose above stated. Unless such notice was given, it is plain that the examination could not be rightfully had. The onus probandi is on the defendants to show it, and unless they produce the notice, the objection must fail. In point of fact, it was admitted by counsel, at the argument, that no such notice was, given. In either view, then, from the admission, or from the defect of the preliminary proof of notice in the record,' the exception is not maintainable. The next exception is to the refusal of the Court to allow certain questions to be put by the defendants to John H. B. Latrobe, a witness introduced by the defendants to maintain the issue on their part. Latrobe, on his examination, stated,   I know Mr. Stimpson by sight and character. He granted to the. Baltimore. and Ohio Railroad Company the privilege of using the curved ways oh their railroad, and all lateral roads connected therewith. I fix the date of the contract in the early part of October, 1834, because I have then a receipt of Mr. Stimpson s counsel, for two thousand five hundred dollars. Mr. Stimpson laid his claim against the Baltimore Company for an infringement of his patent, in 1832. It was referred to me by the Company, and I advised them.  The counsel for the defendants then offered to prove by the same witness, the declarations of the plaintiff and his agent, to the witness, that the settlement made with the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Company with the plaintiff, was not an admission by the said company of the plaintiff s right in the alleged invention, but a mere compromise of a pending suit, disconnected with a grant, in writing, made by the plaintiff'to the said company  and to that end proposed to put the following questions, respectively, and in order, to the witness:   1. Do you know who was the agent or attorney of James Stimpson, in negotiating the arrangement and settlement between him and the company referred to? Who was he? '2. State if any conversations occurred between James Stimpson, or his agent or counsel, at any time, during the negotiations, regarding the rights claimed by him in the patent for curved ways  without reference to the existence of a written contract, or its contents? 3. What were they-?  The Court refused to allow these questions to be put, for the purpose aforesaid. Now, (as has been already intimated,) it is incumbent upon those who insist upon the right to put particular questions to a witness, to establish that right beyond any reasonable doubt,,for the very purpose stated by them  and they are not afterwards at liberty to desert that purpose, and to show the pertinency or relevancy of the evidence for any other purpose, not then suggest d to the Court. It was not pretended at the argument, that the evidence so offered was good evidence in chief, in behalf of the defendants upon the issue in the cause. It was res inter alios acta,  and had no tendency to disprove the defendant s title to the invention, or to support any title set up by the defendants  for no privity was shown between the defendants and the Baltimore Company. As evidence in chief, therefore, it was irrelevaht and inadmissible. The sole purpose for which it was offered, so far as it was then declared- to the Court, was to show, that the compromise with the Baltimore Company was not founded on any admission of the plaintiff s right in the invention. Be it so  it was then inconsequential  for it certainly had no just tendency to disprove his right. If the compromise had been offered on the part of the plaintiff, for the purpose of establishing  his right to the invention, there is no pretence to say that it would have been admissible against.the defendants. In the converse case, it is equally inadmissible for the defendants. But it is now said that the evidence was in fact offered for the purpose of rebutting or explaining certain statemer ?s made by one Ross Winans, a witness called by the defendants, in his answers upon his cross-examination by the plaintiff s counsel. Now, this purpose is not necessarily, or even naturally, suggested by the purpose avowed in the record. Upon his cross-examination, Winans stated:  I understood.there -were arrangements made with th  Baltimore Company.- I heard the Company paid five thousand dollars.  Now, certainly these statements, if objected to by the defendants, would have been inadmissible upon two distinct grounds. 1. First, as mere hearsay  2. And, secondly, upon the broader principle, now well established, although sometimes lost sight of in' our loose practice at trials, that a party has no right to cross-examine any witness except as to facts and circumstances connected with the matters stated in his direct examination. If he wishes to examine him to other matters, he must do so by making the' witness his own, and calling him, as such, in the subsequent progress of the cause. The question then is presented, whether a party can, by his own omission to tatte an objection to the admission of improper evidence brought out on a cross-examination, found a- right to introduce testimony in chief to rebut it or explain it. If upon the cross-examination, Winans . answer had been such as was unfavourable to'the plaintiff, upon the collateral matters thus asked, which were not founded in the issue, he would have been bound by it, and not permitted to-introduce evidence to contradict it.. There is great difficulty in saying that the defendants ought to be in a more favoured predicament, and to acquire rights founded upon the like evidence to which they did not choose to make-.   y objection, although otherwise it could not have been in the causm- But waiving this consideration, the grounds on which we''think the refusal of the Court was right, are  first, that it was not distinctly propounded to the Court, that* the evidence was offered to rebut or explain.Winans  testimony  and, secondly, that in the form in which it was put, it proposed to separate the written contract of compromise from the conyersations and negotiations which led to it, and to introduce the latter without - tS  former, although it might turn out that the written paper miglifraost materially affect or control the presumptions deducible from those conversations, and negotiations. We think, that upon the settled principles of- law, parol evidence bearing upon written contracts and papers, ought not to be admitted without the production of such written contracts or papers, so as to enable both the Court and the jury to see whether or not the admission of the parol evidence in any manner will trench upon the rule, that parol evidence is not admissible to vary or contradict written contracts or papers. The next exception is to the admission of the evidence of William A. Stimpson, Richard Cat n, and George Neilson, as -to certain declarations, and statements, and conversations of the plaintiff, as to his invention prior to the date of his original patent  in order to rebut the evidence of the defendants, as to the invention or use by other persons of the same contrivance, before that date. The objection is, that, upon general principles, the declarations and conversations of a plaintiff, are not admissible evidence in favour of his own rights. As a general rule, this is undoubtedly true. It is, however, but a general rule, and admits, and requires various exceptions. There are many cases in which a party may show his declarations conflict with acts in his own favour, as a part of the res gestae. There are other cases, again, in which his material declarations have been admitted. Thus, for example, in the case of an action for an assault and battery, and wounding, it has been held, that the declarations of the plaintiff, as. to his internal pains, aches, injuries, and' symptoms, to the physician called to prescribe for him, are admissible for the purpose of showing the nature and extent of the injuries done to him. See 1 Phillips on Evidence, ch. 12, sec. 1, p. 200 202, eighth ed., 1838. In many cases of inventions, it is hardly possible in any other manner to ascertain the precise time and exact origin of the particular invention. The invention itself is an intellectual process or operation  and,.like all other expressions of thought, can in many cases scarcely be made known, except by speech. The invention may be consummated and perfect, and may be susceptible of complete description in words, a month, or even a year before it can be embodied in any visible form, machine, or composition of matter. It might take a year to construct a steamboat, after the inventor had completely mastered all the details of his invention, and had fully explained them to all the various artisans whom he might employ to construct the different parts of the machinery. And yet from those very details and explanations, another ingenious mechanic might be able to construct the whole apparatus, and assume to himself the priority of the invention. The conversations and declarations of a patentee, merely affirming that at some former period he invented that particular machine, might well be objected to. But his conversations and declarations, stating that he had made an invention, and describing its details and explaining it Soperations, are properly to be deemed an assertion of his right, at that time, as an inventor to the extent of the' facts and details which he then makes known  although not of their existence at an antecedent time. In short, such conversations and declarations, coupled with a description of the nature and objects of the invention, are to be deemed a part of the res gestas  and legitimate evidence that the invention was then known to and claimed by him, and thus its origin may be fixed at least as early as that period. This view of the subject covers all the parts of the testimony of the witnesses objected tp in the Circuit Court  and we are of opinion, that the Court were right in admitting the evidence. The next and last exception is, to the rejection of the evidence of Dr. Jones, who was offered to prove that there were material differences between the patent of 1831, and the renewed patent of 1835, and to explain these differences. No doubt can be entertained that the testimony thus offered was, or might be, most material to the merits of the defence. And the question is not as fo the competency or relevancy of the evidence, but as to the propriety of its being admitted at the time when it was offered. It appears that the testimony was not offered by the defendants, or stated by them as a matter of defence, in the stage of the cause when it is usually introduced according to the practice of the' Court. It was offered after  the defendants  counsel had stated in open Court, that they had closed their evidence, and after the plaintiff, in consequence of that declaration, had discharged his own witnesses. The question, then, is, whether it was at that time admissible on the part of the defendants as a matter of right  or whether its admission was a matter resting in the sound discretion of the Court. If the latter, then it is manifest that the rejection of it canno.t be assigned as error. The mode of conducting trials, the order of introducing evidence, and the times when it is to be introduced, are, properly, matters belonging to the practice of the Circuit Courts, with which this Court ought not to interfere  unless it shall choose to prescribe some fixed, general rules on the subject, und r the authority of the act of Congress. Probably the practice in no two states of the Union is exactly the same  and then - ore, in each state, the Circuit Courts must necessarily be vested with a large discretion, in the regulation of their practice. If every party had a right to introduce evidence at any time, at his own. election, without reference to the stage of the trial  in which it is, offered, it is obvious that the proceedings of the Court would often be greatly embarrassed, the purposes of justice be obstructed, and the parties themselves be surprised by evidence destructive of their rights, which they could not have foreseen, or in any manner have guarded against. It seems to us, therefore, that all Courts ought to be, as indeed they generally are, invested with a large discretion on this subject, to prevent the most mischievous consequences in the administration of justice to suitors  and we think that the Circuit Courts possess this discretion in as ample a manner as other judicial tribunals. We do not feel at liberty, therefore, to interfere with the exercise of this discretion  and, indeed, if we were called upon to say upon the present record, whether this discretion was, in fact, misapplied or not, we should be prepared to say, that we see no reason to doubt that it was, under all the, circumstances, wisely and properly exercised. It is sufficient for-us, however, that it was a matter of discretion and practice, in respect to which we possess no authority to revise the decision of the Circuit Court. Upon the whole, we are of opinion, that the judgment of the Circuit Court ought to be affirmed with costs. attorneys:  The case was argued by Mr. Coxe, and Mr. Southard, for the plaintiffs in error  and by Mr. J. R. Ingersoll, for the defendant.    Mr. Coxe and Mr. Southard, on the first exception.

Action for the violation of a patent right, granted to the patentee for   a new and useful improvement in turning short curves on railroads.  On the 26th September, 1835, a second patent was granted, the original patent, granted in 1831, having been surrendered and cancelled on account of a defective specification  . the second patent being for fourteen years from the date bf the .original patent. The second patent was in the precise form of the Srigihal, except the recital of the fact, that ' the former patent was cancelled   on account  f a defective specification,  and the statement of the time the second patent was to begin to run. It was objected that the   second patent should not be admitted in eyidence on the trial of the case, because^it did not contain any recitals that the- prerequisites of the act of Congress of 1836, authorizing the renewal of patents, had been complied with. Held: that this objection cannot,' in point of law, be maintained. The patent was issued under the . great seal of the United States, and is signed by the President, and countersigned by. the Secretary of State. It is a presumption of law, that all public offieers, and especially such high functionaries, perform their proper official duties, until the contrary is proved. Where an act is to be done, or patent granted upon evidence and proofs to be laid before a public officer, upon which he is to decide, the fact that he has done the act, in granting the patent, is prima facie evidence that the proofs have been regularly made, and were satisfactory. No other tribunal is at liberty to re-examine or controvert the sufficiency of such proofs,  when the law has made the officer the proper judge of their sufficiency and competency. . Patents for lands, equally with patents for inventions, have, in  Courts of justice, been deemed prima facie evidence that they have been regularly granted, whenever they have been produced under the great seal of the government, without any recitals or proofs that the, prerequisites of the acts under which they have been issued have been duly observed. In cases of patents, the United States have gone one step further  and as the patentee is required' to make oath that he is. the true inventor, before he can obtain a patent, the     patent has been deemed prima facie evidence that he has made the invention. It is incumbent on those who seek to show that the examination of a witness has been improperly rejected, to establish their right to have the evidence admitted  for the Court will be presumed to have acted correctly, until the contrary is established. To entitle a party to examine a witness in a patent cause, the purpose of whdse testimony is to disprove tjie right of the patentee to the invention, by showing its use prior to the patent by others, the provisions of the patent act of 1836, relative to notice, must be strictly complied with. It is incumbent on those who insist upon the right to put particular^questions to a witness, to establish that right beyond any reasonable doubt, for the very purpose stated by them  and they, are not afterwards at liberty to desert that purpose, and to show the pertinency or relevancy of the evidence for any other purpose not then suggested to the Court. A party has no right to cross-examine any witness, except as to facts and circumstances connected with the matters stated in his direct examination. If he wishes to examine him on other matters, he must do so by making the witness his Own  and calling him as such, in the subsequent progress of the cause. A party cannot, by his own omission to take an objection to the admission of improper evidence, brought out on a cross-examination, found a right to introduce testimony in chief, to rebut it or explain it. Parol evidence, bearing upon written contracts and papers, ought not to be admitted in evidence, without the production of such written contracts or papers  so as to enable both the Court and the jury to see whether or not the admission of the parol evidence in  any manner, yvill trench upon the rule that parol evidence is not admissible to vary or contradict written contracts or papers. As a general rule, and upon general principles, the declarations and conversations of the .plaintiff ore not admissible evidence in favour of his own rights. This is, however, but . a general rule, and admits and requires various exceptions. There are many cases in which a party may show his declarations comport with, acts in his own favour, as a part of the res geste. There are other oases in which his material declarations have been admitted. In an action for an assault and battery and wounding, the' declarations of the plaintiff to his internal pains, aches, injuries, .and symptoms, to the physician attending him, are admissible for the purpose of showing the nature and extent of the injuries done to him. In many cases of inventions, it is hardly possible in any other manner to ascertain the precise time and exact origin of the invention. . The conversations and declarations of a patentee, merely affirming that at some former period he had invented a particular machine, may well be objected to. But his conversations and declarations, stating that he had made an invention, and describing its details, and explaining its operations, are properly deemed an assertion of his right, at that time, as an inventor, to the extent of the facts and details which he then makes known, although not of their existence at an anterior time. Such declarations, coupled with a description of the nature and objects of the invention, are to be deemed a part of the res gestee, and legitimate evidence that the invention was then known and claimed by.him  and thus its origin may be fixed at least as early as that period. If the rejection of evidence is a matter resting in the sound discretion of the Court, this cannot be assigned as error. The mode of conducting trials, the order of introducing evidence, and the times when it is to be introduced, are properly matters belonging to the practice of the Circuit Courts, with which the Supreme Court ought not to interfere  unless it shall chose to prescribe some fixed general- rules on the subject, under the authority of the act of Congress. The Circuit Courts poss ss this discretion in as ampi  a manner as other judicial tribunals.   ' Testimony was not .offered by a defendant, or stated by him as matter of defence, in the stage of the cause when it is usually introduced according to the practice of the Court. It was offered after the defendant s counsel had stated, in open Court, that they had closed their evidence, and after the plaintiff, in consequence of that declaration, had discharged his own witness. The Circuit Court refused to admit the testimony. Held, that this decision was proper. IN error from the Circuit Court of the United States for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. At the April session of the Circuit Court, James Stimpson instituted an action against the plaintiffs in error, for the recovery of damages, for the violation of a patent granted to him by the United States, on the 26th day of September, 1835, for  a new and useful improvement in the mod  of turning short curves on railroads.  The case was tried on the 16th day.of February, 1839  anda Verdict was rendered for the plaintiff, for the sum of four thousand two hundred and fifty dollars. On the 6th of May, 1839, a remit-liter was entered on the docket of the Coiirt, for the sum of one thousand dollars  and a judgment was entered for the plaintiff for three thousand two hundred and fifty dollars. On the trial of the cause, the defendants tendered a bill of Exceptions to the decision of the Court, on their admitting the patent to the plaintiff in evidence  and to other rulings of the Court in the course'of the trial. The defendants prosecuted this writ of error. The patent granted by the United States to James Stimpson was as follows :  The United States of America  to all to whom these letters patent shall come.   Whereas, James Stimpson, a citizen of the United States, hath alleged that he has invented a new and useful improvement in the mode of turning short curves on railroads, for .which letters patent were granted the twenty-third day of August, 1831  which letters being hereby cancelled' on account of a defective specification  which improvement, he states, has not been known or used before his application, hath made oath that he does verily believe that he is the true inventor or discoverer' of the said' improvement, hath paid into, the treasury of the United States, the sum of thirty dollars, delivered a receipt for the same, and presented a petition to the Secretary of State, signifying a desire of obtaining, an exclusive property in the said improvement, and praying that a patent may be granted for that purpose.   These .are, therefore, to grant according to law, to the said James Stimpson, his heirs, administrators, or assigns, for the term of fourteen years from the twenty-third day of August, 1831, the full and exclusive right and liberty of making, constructing, using, and vending to others to be used, the said improvement, a .description whereof is- given in the words of the said James Stimpson himself, in the schedule hereto annexed. - Tested at Washington, under the seal of 'the United States, on the 26th day of September, 1836, by . the President of the United States  and certified in the usual form by the Attorney General of'  the -United .States.   The schedule referred to in these letters patent, and making a part of the same,  .contained  a description in the words of the said James Stimpson himself, of his improvement, in the mode of turning short curves on railroads, for' which letters patent -were granted, dated the twenty-third day of August, 1831, which letters patent being hereby cancelled, on account of a defective specification.  The specification describes the invention with minute particularity,  and concludes:  What I claim as my invention, or improvement, is the application of the flanches of the wheels on one side of railroad carriages, and of the treads of the wheels on the other side, .to turn curves upon railways, .particularly such as turning the corners of the streets,.wharves, &e., in cities and elsewhere, operating upon the principle herein set forth. . The bill of exceptions stated, that the counsel for the plaintiff offered in evidence the patent and specification, to the admission of which in evidence, the counsel for .the defendant objected  but the objection was overruled by the Court, and the evidence was. admitted.   2. The defendants offered to give in evidence, by Josiah White, the description of a flange upon one side of the railroad cars, and the running upon the tread of the wheel upon the other side, with the flange in a groove, for the turning.of curves, which he had seen in use before the date of plaintiff s patent  which was objected-to by- the counsel for the plaintiff, and the objection sustained by the Court. . The objection of the counsel for the flaintiff to the introduction of the testimony of Josiah White, was founded on the absence of the notice required by the act of Congress of the use of the machine at Mauch Chunk  at which .place, it was said, his testimony would show it had been used. 3. The third exception was to the refusal of the Court to allow the defendants to introduce proof of the conversations between the patentee >and the counsel of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Company, while an arrangement of a suit against the Company was made, as to the character and effects of the arrangements. 4. The counsel for the plaintiff, by rebutting evidence, to extend his claim to the invention prior to the time at which, the defendants had. proved the reduction of the same into use and practice by others, offered to give evidence by witnesses of the conversations of the patentee on the subject of his invention at an anterior period  which conversations were intended to show the making of the invention by the patentee, before and at the period when the s me took place. The counsel for the defendants objected to the admission of this testimony  but the Court overruled the objection. 5. The fifth exception was to the refusal of the Court to admit the examination of-Dr. Thomas P. Jones. The plaintiff had discharged his witnesses on the declaration of the defendants  counsel that they had closed their evidence. The testimony asked from Dr. Jones, was to new facts. The Court refused to admit the testimony, on the ground that the testimony was improper, and that it was offered too late. The case was argued by Mr. Coxe, and Mr. Southard, for the plaintiffs in error  and by Mr. J. R. Ingersoll, for the defendant. Mr. Coxe and Mr. Southard, on the first exception. The patent should not have been admitted in evidence. On its face it is inoperative, and invalid.   It is not a patent under the act of Congress of 1793'  but it purports to be a substituted patent for one which had been surrendered. It gives to the patentee the same privileges as those which were given by the first patent. It, therefore, should be in strict arid exact conformity with the law of 1793, as well as with the subsequent act of Congress, authorizii g the surrender of a patent for an imperfect specification, and the issue of another. The act of 21st February, 1793, requires, by its third section, that the applicant shall be the true inventor of the machine, &c. This is made a sine qua non to the granting the patent, and the oath of the claimant is required to this fact. This provision makes the oath necessary, before the Secretary of State has authority to grant the pateut. There is no remedy, if this has been omitted. There was no decision before the case of Morris vs. Huntington, Paine s Reports, 348, which affirmed the right of a patentee to surrender his patent for an erroneous or imperfect specification. After this case, Congress authorized such a surrender. Act of Congress of July 3d, 1832. By this- act the cause of the surrender must be made   out to the satisfaction of. the Secretary- of State, when a second patent is asked for. It has been decided, that a patent- is prima facie, evidence of th  statements on the face of the patent. This does not give any other validity to those statements  and it is not sufficient that some of the requirements of the act of Congress  are stated. All must be set forth, and an averment must.be made that every thing has been done. There is no halting'point. Those requirements exist as to any patent granted after the surrender of a patent. The errors or imperfections in the specification, on which, the surrender- has been made, should be stated. Grant vs. Raymond, 6 Peters, 218. In the case cited, there was a recital of the surrender of the patent, and the cause of its surrender. There is in the patent which was before the Circuit Court, no recital of the imperfections of the first specification  no allegation that there was no fraud in the transaction. There is nothing shown but the gratuitous act of the officer in granting the second patent. And yet all the prerequisites to the grantihg of a second patent should appear in it, as well as be of record in the patent office. Without thSse essential features in a patent given on the surrender of a previous one for the same invention, it camiot be read in evidence to a jury. The requirements in both the acts of Congress of 1792, and 1832, must appear in it. If.all those matters are not shown,' the second patent stands as a new patent: and by allowing- it to be given in evidence, the Court altogether disregard the law. If the patent, in this imperfect form, is admitted as prima facie proof, all the burden of contradicting it is thrown on' the opposite party. Cited, on these points,- Shaw ws.-Cooper, 7 Peters, 245.  ' -In support of the second exception, the couns l contended that A>the notice given was sufficient to authorize the introduction of the testimony of Josiah White. Cited, on this point, Evans vs. Eaton, Peters  C. C. R. 322. Wheat. Rep. S. C. The notice would have been'sufficient under the act of Congress of 1793, arid why not under the act of July 3d, 1836 ?  The objection to the introduction of the evidence by the counsel for the-defendants,-which was sustained by the Court, and which is the subject of the defendants  third exception, was well, taken. It was- in the power of the plaintiff to have produced his contract with the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Company, and have rendered this evidence unnecessary.' He did not do so. As to the fourth exception. It is admitted, that it was the right of the plaintiff to prove,-b.y legal rebutting evidence, that the invention made by him, and for which he held the patent, was in use before the period in which the defendant had proved the invention by him. Butlhis evidence could not be given  by showing the conversations of the plaintiff on the subject of the invention before the date of the first patent. ' Conversations on the subject of an invention ar  not the invention  nor are the ideas of the invention, its actual development. There must be an application of the thought, in the construction of the- machine. This is an attempt to give the declarations of a party in evidence, after the actual occurrence of the transaction. No declaration of a person that he intended to take' out a patent, could be given in evidence. Cited,-on this point, 1 Wheat. Rep. 313. 10 Serg. and Rawle, 27. 5 Serg. and Rawle, 295. Roscoe on Evidence, 21. 4 Washington C. C. R. 58. 5 Mason, 6. 1 Gallis, C. C. R. 438. As to the fifth exception, the counsel contended, that the evidence of Dr. Jones was rebutting evidence, and was regular  as it was offered to meet and to disprove the plaintiff s declarations, which the Court had admitted as testimony. Mr. Ingersoll, for the defendants in error. 1  The.objection to the certificate of the Secretary of State should apply rather to the effect than the admissibility of the document. That officer is authorized by law to issue patents, and the presumption is, that he has done so rightfully. Possession of the document does not affect the intrinsic rights of any one. Every question of merjt is still open. It enables the-patentee to sue  but it neither secures him in the enjoyment of the alleged invention, nor preludes other s from contesting the validity of his claims. In the different cases cited, the patent appears to have been received in evidence exactly in the form now exhibited, although it may have availed nothing to the plaintiff afterwards. 1 Sullivan vs. Redfield, 1 Paine, 447:  The patent is prima facie evidence off the right.  The Margaretta, 2 Gall. 519: Remission, though not valid, was given in evidence. See also Bingham vs. Cabot, 3 Dali. 19. Bell vs. Morrison, 1 Peters, 355. Keene vs. Meade, 3 Peters, 6. The United States 'vs. Liddle, 2 Wash. C. C. Rep. 205. 2. The testimony of Josiah White would have been admitted under the sixth section of the law of 1793. But the fifteenth (or corresponding) section of the law of 1836, requires notice of place, person, and residence. As the law previously stood, great injustice might have been done, unless the Court had construed it* so as to invest the .judge with power to prevent the plaintiff from being taken by surprise. Evans vs- Eaton, 3 Wheat. 505. The law now wisely anticipates the necessity for .an exercise of judicial discretion and possible delay  and requires notice of the place where the improvement is supposed by a defendant to have been previously used. This was not given, and the testimony was necessarily rejected. 3. Although, in truth, the offer to examine Mr. Latrobe upon certain points was not rejected by the Court, but withdrawn by the Counsel, yet as it appears by the record to have been a point decided, I'will submit to treat it accordingly.. The testimony would no doubt have been rejected if the offer had been persisted in, and the delay that would be requisite to put the record right would be deeply injurious to my client. (1.) The inquiries suggested for the witness are impracticable, and they lead to impracticable results. The inquiry refers to a   negotiation,   arrangement,  and  settlement.  It asserts the fact that a  grant  or  contract,  was made. Negotiation is the necessary preliminary to a contract, is absorbed in it, and forms a part of it. How can you separate them ? Out of one identified existence, two things are to be made, essentially distinct from each other. That is impossible. (2.) The inquiries are irrelative. The arrangement'contemplated was res inter alios acta. The plaintiffs in error were altogether strangers to it. Many inducements may lead to a settlement with  one person which would not render it desirable with another. If it were not that Ross Winans had previously been cross-examined by the-counsel for the plaintiffs in the Circuit Court, to the point of settlement with the Baltimore and Ohio Company, no pretence for the inquiry would -exist. If that was wrong, this will not make it right. It was not objected to. If not strictly cross-examination, we , had no right to resort to it. Ellmalrer vs. Buckley, 16 Serg. and Rawle. If it was regular cross-examination, it cannot justify the proposed irregularity. But we were bound to put the witness on his guard as to a'collateral fact which might impeach his testimony.. Rule in the Queen s case. (3.) The object attempted to be proved was a mere entity  an abstraction: nothing actually done, but at best something omitted or avoided: a conclusion or construction: a contingencv without a substantial thing to support it. (4.) It was an attempt to prove by parol some known written arrangement, which was susceptible  f being produced. 4. Explanations of the patentee himself w.ere good evidence to prove the genuineness of his claims to.originality. It is necessary to understand the manner in which this testimony was produced. Plaintiff at first simply produced his patent, and called a witness who proved its utility and the infringement by the defendants. Then the defendants went at large into proof of alleged priority of invention by other persons. All of this went to show a use before the date of the plaintiff s patent. A necessity was therefore thrown upon him of proving that his invention existed, and was communicated by him to different persons at a still earlier period. No doubt. of the importance of such proof. It consisted of evidence of plaintiff s invention prior to defendants  knowledge, or the knowledge of those persons on whom they relied. To meet this particular exigency, that is, to show invention, it is difficult to conceive what can be authentic except what comes from the inventor himself. He therefore produced several individuals, who stated that he described the improvement to them at a period 'considerably earlier than defendants had fixed for its earliest use. If he described it, he must have known it. If he knew it before any other person, he must have invented it. That prior knowledge was invention  and that was the very thing to be proved. Two objections were taken to the character of the proof: 1st. That it was derived from the plaintiff himself,  2d. That the alleged improvement was not then brought into practical use by him. . Answer 1st. It was an invention  else not patentable: in other words, it must spring from him.self. An exhibition' of it must necessarily in some shape or other be his act. Whatever might be said or done by others could not be available to him. The exhibition might be effected by deeds, signs, or words. It matters not in what particular manner the effect is produced, but the discovery .must make manifest its paternity  and it can do so only through the medium of its-proper parent. This may be done by his works   a machine constructed. Let it be produced  original, practical, perfect in all its parts. Nothing is gained by the author uriless something more than all this appears, viz. authorship. However eloquent the machine may be as to its uses, it cannot speak for itself, as to its author. The nearest it can come to speech would be an inscription or label on its front:   J. S. fecit, for example. - That would at best be a written declaration. What difference would it make that the writing, or stamping, or printing, should be in a book ? That description of evidence in a sister department of the law, is conclusive of important rights. In maintaining copyrights, the writing of the party is the essence of the discovery, and the sole proof <of invention or originality. If, instead of writing with his own hand, the same author dictates to another person, cannot the'- amanuensis prove the dictation, and hence the authorship ? A blind author has often given to the world the result of his genius, through the pen of another. On a question of authorship, sur ly the testimony of the scribe would be received as competent. Amother species of proof of invention remains, namely, oral explanation alone.- Why may it hot be received ? It is the very thing itself. To speak it, was to create it, if it did not already exist in thought  and if it did, it must prove it. The proof was given to counteract the allegation of earlier discovery. It produces the effect by showing that the earlier discoverers, as they are regarded, received'from the plaintiff the information which enabled them to.put the invention in use, and then attempt to deny the right of showing how the information was communicated and obtained. One of the very pieces of testimony objected to consisted of a conversation with the person who claimed to be an inventor in,preference to the plaintiff.. The declarations did not stand alone  they were accompanied by two drawings and a model. The date of the existence of these monuments is clearly proved. The conversations became but a part of the res gestae. There are many occasions on which one s own sayings and doings are good evidence  in some instances the best, and in others the only evidence. The present is an anomaly unless it concurs. It does not follow that the expressions of an individual are the illegal creation of testimony for himself. Such are, 1. Various kinds of declarations ante litem motam  2. When the sayings are the doings, as in cases of notice  3. Where the expressions of an individual are the test of a given state of things, as intellect  4. Proof of a contract, as marriage, by words de present   5. Almost any other discovery or invention,   not connected with the useful arts. A reward is offered for lost property: the finder informs of the finding of it: the declarations can be proved. Answer 2d. As to the objection that the explanations were not   reduced to practice. Here, too, the objection loses sight of the fact that our evidence was not original, but merely designed to meet a. collateral issue as to the period of invention, and not exactly as to invention itself. On any ground, howeyer, the question of invention does not depend upon whether the thing has been reduced to practice, but whether it can be. Not whether it is actually practised, but practicable. Drawings, descriptions, and models are sent' to the patent office. These  re miniature likenesses, not the thing itself. Any other course would, in many instances, be quite impracticable. A ship, a house, a town, are often the recipients of an improvement which cannot be practically exhibited, except in connection with the .vast object to which it is applied. Sometimes the reducing to practice might be destructive of life or property. A guillotine need, not be rehearsed in order to prove its power. Besides, it might destroy the very intention, to insist on practical exercise. . It might be regarded as giving the invention to the pub-. lie, and then the patent right is gone forever. 5. Thomas P. Jones was called by the defendants after all the testimony in chief, on both sides  and the plaintiff s rebutting testi-' mony also had been given, and hi's witnesses dismissed  and much time had been occupied in giving rebutting testimony for the defendants. The declared object was to prove that the invention described in the plaintiff s patent of 1835, was different from the invention described by him in his patent of 1831: in other words, that the patent which purported to be a mere- correction of form, was in substance a totally different thing. We are struck at once with an inconsistency between this point, and the whole tenor of the defendants  c se. The notice which they gave, the aim of their evidence, their great design, is to show that.the thing relied on by the plaintiff, which was patented by him in 1835, was well known and used in 1831  known to everybody, publicly, notoriously. Yet we are now told that it was not known even to the plaintiff himself  but that he found it necessary four years afterwards to desert the alleged invention of 1831, and surreptitiously to foist in a different thing, which then became known to him for the first time. Unl'ess this is the true meaning of the point, it-has none. The evidence offered was original and direct. It contradicted nothing already asserted in evidence. It was directed to a point in no way collateral. It went immediately to the essential' merits of the case. It was of grea( importance, undoubtedly. Nothing could be more .conclusive against the plaintiff. Not only would it be destructive of his claim to originality  but it would prove   most audacious fraud, abortively attempted, and calculated, when detected, to deprive him of all standing in or out of Court, and to render his defeat as disgraceful as it was inevitable. Notice of all this ought to have been given  perhaps. It is not urged, however,-as an argument, that none was received  although it might have been calculated to take the plaintiff by surprise. But it was a fact above all others, requiring, and in its nature admitting of countervailing proof. Not a clerk in the office, probably, could have failed to give material testimony in reply. These persons were at a distance   and, we should have been left to the question of probability, whether a man, in any extremity of impudent-fraud, would have ventured to place two totally different patents side by side in the office, asserting that they were in subst nce identical. ' The evidence offered was not the best the nature of the case admitted of. Contradiction was to be proved between two written instruments, with, perhaps, a model accompanying each of them. Copies would be the proper sources of illustration. Were copies not accessible? We do not know. No inquiry was made. A thousand, copies may have been.made before the'patent office was destroyed. Plaintiff himself, no doubt, had such copies in his possession. No notice was given to him to produce them, before this violent attempt. was made to introduce secondary evidence. To get rid of all this  the argument was that the difference was only to be inferred between the patents from a difference between the conversation and one of them. But that would, rebut nothing. No person denied that plaintiff s conversations with the witnesses he produced, were as they were sworn to be. Other conversations with other persons might show descriptions of oth r inventions  but they could not possibly show that the first conversations did not take place. The judge gave two reasons for rejecting the testimony. One .was, that it was offered at too late a stage of the cause. That was ruled in his sound discretion.. From the exercise of that discretion there is no appeal. No attempt was made to take one. On both of his grounds he was right. But one was sufficient to cover the whole question, and it is inaccessible to review here.\n",

      "judges:   parties:  David Prouty and John Mears, Plaintiffs in error, v. Draper Ruggles et al., Defendants in error. opinions:  Mr. Chief Justice Tan y delivered, the opinion of the Court. This case is brought here by a writ of error - t  the Circuit Court of the United States, for the district of Massachusetts. The action was instituted for the purpose of ', recovering damages for an infringement of a patent, which the plaintiffs had obtained for an improvement in the construction of the plough. The invention is described in the specification, as follows:  Be it known, that we, the said Prouty and Mears,have jointly invented, made, and applied to use, a new and useful improvement in the construction of the plough, which invention and improvement we describe and specify as follows, viz.: Heretofore, the standard and landside of the plough has been placed perpendicular to, and at right angles with the plane of the share  on this standard the beam has been placed in-such manner as to form, an acute angle with the landside, of such extent as to place that part of the beam to which the moving power, is applied at the distance of three of more inches from an extended line of the landside, to the right  while thei after-part of the beam extends one or more inches to the left of the'perpendicular of the landside, near the handle  the object has been to cause the plough  to run. to land/ or hold its width Of furrow. The-effect produced has been an- uneasy, struggling motion, as it meets resistance at the point, wing, or heel. We make our plough with the standard and landside forming an acute angle'with the plane of the share-, the standard inclining to the right or furrow side, in such manner as to enable us to place the centre of the beam on a line parallel with the landside, the forepart thereof at such distance from theextended line aforesaid, as to cause the plough to hold- its width, of furrow, and the after-part falling within the perpendicular of the landside of the plough, the centre of it being nearly perpendicular to the centre of resistance, on the mould-board, which we conceive' to be at about one-fourth part of the lateral distance from the landside to the wing of the share, and at about one-third part of the perpendicular height from the plane - of the share to the upper edge of the mould-board. This locatidn of the centre of resistance, we base on the-fact,that many ploughs which have been used in sharp, sandy soils, have been worn quite through at that point. The result of this formation of the plough, is-a steady, well-balanced motion, requiring less power of draft, and less effort in directing the plough in its course. The inclination of the stand rd and landside canses, the plough to. cut under, and take up the furrow in the form of an bbliqueangled parallelogram, or like a. board, feather-edged, which being turned over, falls in level with the last furrow more'readily than right-angled or square-edged work.' The coulter or knife, having, a similar inclination, cuts the roots of the grass, &c., and leav s all vegetable m'att r on the, surface, at a greater- distance from the under edge of the. furro.w, which being turned over, more readily falls in, and is far better covered than with square-edged work  The top of the standard, through which the bolt passes to .sect  3 the beam, is transversely parallel to-the plane of the share, and extends back from the bolt t  such.distance as to.form-a., brace to the beam, when th  after-part is'passed down by lifting at the forepart  the share being fast under a-rock, or other Obstruction, the after-part of this extension is squared ,in such manner, that being jogged into the beam, it' relieves the bolt in heavy draft. The bolts which we use to fasten the pieces of cast iron, of which our ploughs- are made, together, arid- the wood-work,'are round, with inverted convex heads, like the wood screw, with a projection on the under side of the-.head, -of semicircular form, which fits into a groove in the counter-sink part of the bolt hole, as it is- cast to receive it, which not only prevents its turning, but also diminishes the liability of breakage at the. corners of square holes .all which will more fully appear by reference to the drawing annexed to, and forming part of this specification! We hereby declare, that what we claim as new, and of our invention, is the construction of such ploughs as aforesaid, and the several parts thereof, not separately, but In combination, for the purposes aforesaid, viz.: . 1. The inclining the standard and--landside so as to form an acute angle with the plane of the share. 2. The placing the b ahron a line parallel to the landside, within the .body of the plough and- its centre, nearly in the perpendicular of the centre of resistance. 3. The forming' th  top of. the standard for brace and draft. We do not intend to confine our ciaim to any particular form or construction, excepting such form as may be necessary to place ,the beam in the perpendicular of the centre of resistance, and parallel, to the landside, and also to such form of the top of the standard,  s shall- serve for brace  and. draft, but have given siich form as we deem to be most conveni nt, which may be varied, as is obvious.  The plaintiffs offered to prove the utility of the alleged improvement, which proof was dispensed with by the defendants. Certain, ploughs alleged by the plaintiffs to be made in conformity with their letters patent, and certain ploughs, made by the defendants, which were the alleged infringement of the- plaintiff s patent, were produced in Court  .and no  substantial'difference -between ..them was shown by the defendants to exist, unless'the fact, that the' top of the standard m the defendant s plough was not jogged into the beam,'and did not extend sd -far back upon the-beam, was to be so considefed.  And the plaintiffs offered evidence to show,.that the top of the standard formed, as stated in the specification, would sei-ve for both purposes  f brace and draft,  lthough not jogged into the beam. > The defendants introduced ho evidence. .Tile- counsel for the plaintiffs requested the Court -to instruct -the jury as follows, to wit: The counsel, of plaintiffs respectfully move th  CoUrt to instruct the jury, that if the defendants have used, in combination with- the other two parts, a standard of the description set forth in the specification^ and- it is proved to serve both f r Iprace and draft, such use was an .infringement of the plaintiffs  claim in that particular, although the defendants may not have inserted into a jog in. the beam. . Also, that if any two of the three parts described,, as composing the construction claimed -in the specification, had been used in combination by the defendants, it was an infringement of the patent, although the third had not been used with them. The Court refused, to give the instructions so prayed, or either of them, in manner and form as prayed by the plaintiffs  but did instruct the jury as follows, to wit: That upon the true construction'of the patent, it is for a combination, and for a . combination only. That the combination, as stated in the summing up,- consists , of three things, viz.: 1: The inclining the standard and'landside so as to form an acute angle with the plane of the share. 2. The placing the beam on a line parallel.to the landside, within the body of the. plough and its centre, nearly in the perpendicular of the centre of resistance. 3. . The forming the top of the standard for brace and draft-.,. That Unless it is proved, that the  whole combination is substantially Used in the defendants  ploughs, it is not a violation of the plaintiffs  patent, although One or more of the parts specified, as. aforesaid, may be used, in combination   by the defendants. And  that the plaintiffs, by their -.specification and summing up, have,treated the jogging of the standard behind, as w ll.as .the. extension  t  be essential parts of their combination  for the purpose of brace and draft  and that the Use-of either alon  by the defendants would' not be an infringement of the combination-patented. And thereupon the jury, rendered their verdict for-' the' defendants. The first question presented by the exception is, whether the extension of. the standard, and the jogging of it into the beam, are claimed as material parts of th  plaintiff s improvement: We think they are. In the paragraph in which it is described, he states that it  extends back from the bolt to such a distance as to form a brace to the-beam   'and also,  that being jogged into the beam it relieves the bolt in a heavy draft-.  And in their summing up, they declare that they claim as new,-and of their invention, the. construction of such ploughs as aforesaid, and the several parts thereof, not separately but in .combination ' and proceeding then to specify the parts so claimed, they mention,  the forming of the top of the standard for brace and draft.  They indeed say that they do not mean to confine their claim to any particular form of construetioh, except   to such form of the top as shall serve for brace and draft.  That is to say, the top is to be so formed and so connected with. the. beam as to answer both purposes. And as those purposes, according to the preceding part-of the specification, are to be accomplished by its .extension back from the . bolt, and by jogging it into the beam, these two things are' essential to. it whatever variation may be made in its shape or size. They are, therefore, materi l parts of the improvement they claim. The remaining question may.be disposed, of in a few words. The patent is for a combination, and- the improvement consists in arranging different portions of the plough, aM combining them together in the manner stated in the specification for the purpose of producing a certain effect. None of the parts referred to are new, arid none are claimed- as new  nor is any portion of the combination less than the whole claimed as new, or stated to produce any given result. .The end in view is proposed to be accomplished by the union of all, arranged and combined together in the manner described. And this combination^ composed of all the parts mentioned in the specification, and arranged with reference to each other, and'to other parts of the plough in the manner therein described, is stated- to be the.improvement, and is the thing, patented  The use of any two of these parts only, or. of two combined with a third, which is substantially different, in form or in the manner of its arrangement and connection with the others  is therefore not the thing patented, It ismot the same combination if it substantially differs from it in any of its parts. The jogging o  the standard-'into the beam, and its extension backward from the,bolt, are both treated by the plaintiffs' as essential parts of thqir combination for the purpose, of brace and draft. Consequently the .use of either alone,-by. the defendants, would not be the. same improvement, nor infringe the -patent of the plaintiffs. The judgment of the Circuit Court must therefore be affirmed. attorneys:  The case was submitted to the Court on printed argunients by Mr. Choate, for the plaintiffs in error , and by Mr. Dexter, for the defendants. The case is fully stated in the opinion of the Court. corrections:  head_matter: David Prouty and John Mears, Plaintiffs in error, v. Draper Ruggles et al., Defendants in error. The plaintiffs, in the Circuit Court, claimed damages for the'infringement of their patent for  a new and useful improvement in the construction of a plough.  . The claim of the patentees was for the combination of certain parts of the plough, not for the parts separately. The Circuit Court- charged the jury, that unless it is proved that   the whole combination is substantially used in the defendant s ploughs, it is not a violation of the'plaintiff s patent  although one or more' of the parts specified in the letters patent may be used in combination by the defendant. The plaintiffs, by their specification and summing up, treated the parts described as essential parts of their combination, for the purpose of brace and draft  and the use of either alone by the defendant would not be an infringement of the combination patented. 'Held, that the instructions of the Circuit Court were correct. The patent is for a combination, and the improvement consists in arranging different por-   tions of the plough, and combining them together in the manner stated in the  specification, for the purpose of producing a certain effect.' None of the paTts referredto are new, and none are claimed as new  nor is any portion of the combination less than the whole claimed as new, or stated to produce any given result. The end in view is proposed to be accomplished by the union of all, arranged and combined together in the manner described 'and this combination, composed of all the parts mentioned in the specification, and arranged with reference to each other, and to other parts of the plough, in the manner therein described, is stated to be the improvement, and is the thing patented. The use of any two of these parts only, or of two combined with a third, which is substantially different in the form,- or in the-manner of its arrangement and connection with the others, is, therefore, not the thing patented. It is not the same combination, if it substantially differs from it in any of its parts. IN error to the Circuit Court of the United States, for the district of Massachusetts. The plaintiffs in error instituted a suit, in the Circuit Court of Massachusetts, for the recovery of damages for the violation of   patent granted to them by the United States, for a new and useful improvement in the construction of a plough. The cause was tried before a jury, at October sessions of the Circuit Court, in 1841, and a verdict and judgment were rendered for the defendant. The plaintiffs took exceptions to the charge of the Court, and prosecuted this writ of error. The case was submitted to the Court on printed argunients by Mr. Choate, for the plaintiffs in error , and by Mr. Dexter, for the defendants. The case is fully stated in the opinion of the Court.\n",

      "judges:   parties:  William T. McClurg, John C. Parry, and Enoch J. Higby, Partners, doing business under the firm of McClurg, Parry, and Higby, Assignees of James Harley, Plaintiffs in error, v. Lawrence Kingsland, Isaac Lightner and James Cuddy, Partners, doing business under the firm of Kingsland, Lightner, and Cuddy, Defendants. opinions:  Mr. Justice BALDWIN. delivered the opinion of the court. Phis cas.e comes here on a writ of error to the Circuit Court -for' the western district of Pennsylvania, in an action brought by the plaintiffs, assignees of James Harley, against the. defendants, for the' infringement of a patent granted to Harley for  an improvement in the . lode of casting chilled rollers and other metallic cylinders and cones, in. which judgment .was rendered for the defendants. On the trial it appeared in evidence that it had long been a desideratum to find out some mode by which iron rollers or cylinders,, could be so cast that when the metal was introduced into the mould it should cause a swyrl or rotatory motion, by which the flog or dross would be thrown into the c ntre, instead of the surface of the cylinder. By the old mode, the metal .was conveyed from the furnace-to the mould through a gate, or pipe, placed in a horizontal or perpendicular direction. The mode alleged to have been invented by Harley is thus described in the specification annexed to the patent :    The tube or tubes,or passages called gates, through which the metal, to be conveyed into the moulds shall not enter the mould perpendicularly at the bottom, but slanting, or. in a direction approaching to a tangent of the cylinder, or if' the gates enter the moulds horizontally or nearly so, shall not enter in the. direction of the axis of i' ie cylinder, but in a tangent form, or inclining towards a tangent of the cylinder. -   This- was the thing patented, consisting solely in changing the direction of the tube, which conveyed the metal to the mould, from a horizontal or perpendicular position to an angular one-  it produced the desired effect and was highly useful. The novelty of the invention was much contested at the trial, but as the case turned on - other points, that becam  an immaterial question  -as the case comes before us  on exceptions to the charge of the court, which assumed that Harley was the original and true inventor of the improvement, and put the case to the jury on the following facts, which were in full proof, in nowise contradicted, and admitted to. be true. ' That-Harley was employed by the defendants at their foundry in-Pittsburgh, receiving wages from them by the week  while so employed, he claimed to have.invented the improvement .patented, and after several unsuccessful' experiments made a. successful one in October, 1834  the experiments were made in the defendants  foundry,- and wholly at their expense, while Harley was receiving his wages, which-were increased oh account of the useful result. Harley continued .in their employment on wages until January or. February,. 1835, during all which, time he made rollers-for them  he often spoke about procuring a,patent, and prepared more than one set of papers for the purpose  made his application the 17th February, 1835, for a patent  it was granted-on the 3d of . March, assigned to the plaintiffs on the 16th of March, pursuant to an agreement made in January. While Harley continued in the defendants  employment, he proposed that they should take out a patent and purchase his right, which they declined  he made' no demand on them for any compensation fdr using his improvement  nor gave them' any notice not to use it, till, on some misunderstanding on another subject, he ga'Ve them such notice, about the time of his leaving their foundry, and after making the agreement with the plaintiffs, who owned a foundry in Pittsburgh, for an assignment to them of his right. ' The defendants continuing to make rollers on Harley s plan,, the present action was brought in October, 18-35, without any previous-notice by them. The court left it to the jury to decide what the facts of the case were  but if they were as testi-. . lied, charged that they would fully justify the presumption of a license, a special privilege, or grant to the defendants -to use the invention  that the facts amounted to  -a consent and allowance of such use-,  and show such -a consideration-as would support ' an express.license or grant, or call- for the presumption of 'one to meet the justice of the case, by exempting .them from liability  having-equal effect with a license, and giving the defendants a right to the continued use of the invention. The court- also charged the jury, that the facts of the case, which were not controverted, brought it within the provisions of the 7th section of the act of 1839, by the unmolested, notorious use of- the invention, before the application'for a-patent by Harley, and that nothing had been shown by the plaintiffs to counteract the effect off this prior use. That as assignees of Harley  the plaintiffs-- stand in his place, as to right and responsibility  they took the assignment of the patent, subject to the legal consequences of his previous acts, and-connecting these with the absence of an assertion of a right adverse to the defendants use till this suit was brought, protected the defendants from liability for any damages therefor. The exceptions to the charge were confined to these two points, which constitute the only subject for our consideration. Whether these exceptions are well taken or not, must depend on the law as it stood at the emanation of the patent, together with such changes as have been since made  for though they may be -retrospective in their operation, that is not a sound objection to their validity  the powers of Congress to legislate upon the subject of patents is'plenary by the terms of the Constitution, and as there ar  no restraints on its exercise, there can be no limitation o  their right to modify them, at their pleasure, so that they do not take away the rights of property in existing patents. When the patent to Harley was granted, and this suit brought, the acts of 1793 and 1800 were the tests of its validity, but the 21st section of the act of 1836 repealed all existing laws on the subject, of patents, with a proviso, that all suits brought before may be prosecuted in the same manner as if that act- had not been passed,   excepting and saving the application to any such action, of the provision of the 14th and 15th sections of this act, so far as they may be applicable thereto.5  This repeal, however, can have no effect to impair the right of property then existing in a patentee, or his assignee, according to the well-established principles of this court in 8 Wheat. 493  the patent must therefore stand as if the acts of 1793 and 1800 remained in force  in other respects the -14th and 15lh sections of the act of 1836 prescribe the rules which must govern'on the trial^of actions' for the violation of patented rights, whether granted before or  after its passage. In Pennock v. Dialogue, this court held,-in 1829,  That if an inventor makes, his discovery public, looks on, and permits others freely to use it, without objection or assertion- of. claim to the invention,  of which the public . might take notice  he abandons the inchoate right' to 'the exclusive use of the invention, to which a patent would have entitled him, had it been applied for, before such use, and that 'it mak s no difference in the principle, that the article so publicly used, and afterwards patented, was made by a particular individual who did so by the private permission  f the inventor.  2 Peters, 14,15  S. P. Grant v. Raymond, 6 Peters, 248, 249  Shaw v. Cooper, 7 Peters, 313   323. On this construction of the acts of ,1793 and 1800, Harley s patent would have been void, on the evidence in this case. Such seems to have been the sense of Congress, as expressed,in,the act of 1832, which authorized the issuing a new patent, when', an original one was invalid by accident, inadvertence,-or mistake, arid without  any fraudulent intent, by reason  f the terms of the 3d section of the act of 1793 not having been complied, with,  Provided,however, that such new patent so granted shall.in all respects be liable to the same matters of objection and defence as any original patent, granted under the said first-mentioned act. That no public us  or privilege of the invention so patented, derived from or after the grant of the original patent, either under any special license of the inventor, or without the corisent of the patentee that there shall be free public use thereof, shall.in any manner prejudice the right of recovery for any use or violation of his invention after the' grant of such new patent, as aforesaid.  4 Story, 2301. This act is an affirmance of the principles laid down by this court in the three cases before referred to,- and as the exception to. the proviso is limited to an use of the invention under a spe-' cial license of the inventor after the grant of the original patent, it leaves the use .priorfo the application for such patent clearly obnoxious to the principle established in 2 Peters, 14,.15, whereby the patent would become void. The same conclusion follows froin the 15th section of the act of 1836, which declares, that if the thing patented   had been in public use, or on sale, with the consent and allowance of the p tentee, before the application for a patent,  judgment shall be rendered for the defendant with costs. 4 Story, 2511. The case before us is one' of this description: the defendants use the invention of Harley for four months before his application for a patent  this use was public, and not only with his express consent and allowance, but he himself made the rollers on the plan he invented during those months, from the time when he had ascertained the utility of his invention. It would, therefore, be no strained,-if not the fair construction of this act, if under such and the other circumstances in evidence in the cause, the court had charged the jury, that if they believed the- witnesses, the patent subsequently obtained was void. The Circuit Court, however, did not go so far: they held that the defendants might, continue to use the inventibn, without saying that the public might use it, without liability to the plaintiffs, in which we think there was no error in their direction to the jury  that they might presume a license or grant from Harley, or on the legal effect of the uncontroverted evidence as to the right of recovery, by the plaintiffs, or on the construction of the acts of 1793, 1800, - 1832, and 1836. , The remaining exception is to the charge of the court below, on the effect of the' 7th section of the act of 1839, which is in these words:   That every person or. corporation who has, or shall have purchased or constructed any newly-invented machine, manufacture, or composition of matter, prior to the application by the.inventor or discoverer of a patent, shall-be held to possess the right to useand vend to others to be used, the specific machine, manufacture, or composition of matter, so   made or purchased, without liability therefore to the. inventor, or. any other person interested in such invention  and no-patent'shall be held invalid by reason of such purchase, sale,-or use prior to the application  for a patent as aforesaid, except on proof pf abandonment- of such invention to the public, or that such purchase, sale, or prior use has been for more than two years prior W such application for a patent.  Pamphlet Laws, 1839, 74, 75. ' The object of this provision is evidently twofold    first, to protect tlie person who has used the thing patented, by having purchased, constructed, or made the machine, &c., to which the invention is applied, from any liability to the patentee or his assignee'. Second, to protect the rights, granted to the patentee, against any infringement by any other persons. This relieved him from the. effects of former laws and their constructions by this court, unless-in case of an abandonment of the invention, or a continued prior use'for more than two years before the application for a patent, while it puts the person who has.had such prior use on the same footing as if he had a special .license from the inventor to Use his invention  which, if given before the application for a patent, would justify the continued use after it issued without liability. At the trial below, and here, the plaintiff s counsel have contended, that this act cannot apply to the present case, iuasmuchas the protection it affords to the .person who had the prior use, is confined to the specific' machine, &c<, and does not extend to such use of the invention, or- thing patented, if it does not consist of a-machine, &c., as contradistinguished from the new mode or manner in which an old machine or its parts operates, so as to produce the desired effect  but we think that the law does not admit of such construction, whether we look at its words or its manifest objects, when taken in connection with former laws, and the decisions of this court in analogous cases. The words  such invention  must be referred-baclc to the preceding part of the sentence, in order to ascertain the subject-matter, to which it relates, which is none other than the newly-invented machine, manufacture, or' composition of matter constituting the thing patented  otherwise these words become senseless when the invention is-uot strictly of a machine, &c. Now, in-'the present case, we find the invention consists solely in the angular direction given to the tube through which the me.tal is conducted into the cylinder in which the roller is.cast. Every part of the machinery is old, the roller itself is no part-of the invention, and cannot be the machine, manufacture, or composition of matter contemplated by Congress, nor ban the word  f specific -  -have any practical effect unless it is applied to the thing patented,-whatever it may be, without making a distinction between a machine, &c.', and the mode of producing a useful, result by the mere direction ' given to one of the parts of ah old machine. Such a construction  ' is not justified by the language of the law, and would d feat both of its objects.   If it does. not embrace the- ease before us, the consequence would be that the use of the invention, under the circhinstances in' evidence, would, according to the decision in 2 Peters, 14,15, invalidate the patent  for if the act operates to save the avoidance of the patent  it must, of consequence, protect the -person who uses the invention before the application  for a patent. Both objects must be effected, or both must fail, as both parts of the act refer to .the same thing, and the same . state of things, as affecting the person using the newly-invented machine, or the thing patented, as well- as the' inventor.. Had the words   invention,  or   tiling patented,  been used instead of machine, Sic., there- could have been no room for doubt of the' application of the act to the present, case  and by referring to the phraseology of the.different acts of Congress denoting the.invention. it is apparent that, though there-is a difference in the words' used, there is none as to their meaning or reference to the same thing.

This case was brought up by writ of error from the Circuit Court of the United States for the western district of Pennsylvania. The facts are sufficiently stated in the opinion of the court. .The.bill of exceptions which.was taken on the trial below was as follows  . And the plaintiff thereupon excepted to certain parts of the instruction's so given by the court to the jury,, which instructions so excepted to are hereinafter' set forth, to wit:  It has, however  been urged by the plaintiff s counsel that the right to the continued1 use is restricted to the   specific machine, manufacture, or-e mposition of matter so made-or purchased,  so that a defendant is protected no farther than in the case of the invention . (for which this patent was granted) prior to the application, and is liable, to damages if-he makes -any rolls by-Harley s .plan afterwards.   We, therefore, feel bound to take the words,   newly invented machine,  in the act of-. 1839, manufacture, or .composition of matter and such invention, to mean the invention patented, and the words  specific machine,'  to refer to the thing originally invented, whereof the exclusive right is procured by patent, but not to any. newly discovered improvement to an existing patent.   The use of the patent must be of the same specific improvement originally invented,-as was before the application used by any person who had purchased or constructed the machinery on which he operated to produce the effect described in the specification  but when such-person, confines the future case to the specific mode, method, manner, and process of producing the described effect, it te - by the words and true meaning Of the law, without liability to the inventor or other person interested in the invention, so construed  and by thus protecting the person who has engaged the use of an invention before the application for a' patent, the great object of the patent laws, as declared in the' 4th section of the act of 1837, will be consummated  that is, to' project the rights of the public and  of patentees in patented inventions and improvements.  4 Story, 2547. A different construction would make it necessary to carry into all the former laws the same literal exposition of the various terms used to express the same thing, and thereby changing the law according to every change of phraseology, make it a labyrinth of inextricable confusion.   Our opinion, therefore, is, that the defendants have a right to the continued' use of the improvement patented to Harley  the facts of the case, which are not controverted, have- equal 'effect with a license, and the evidence brings the defendant under the protection of the act of 1839, by the unmolested notorious use of the invention before the application for a patent. Nothing has been shown on the part of the plaintiffs to counteract the effect of this prior use  as assignees of Harley, they stand in his place as to right ahd responsibility  they took the patent, subject to the legal consequences of his previous acts, and connecting these with the want of an assertion of   right, to the use by the defendants of the invention patented, till this suit was brought in ' September, 1835, protects them from liability.  In pur opinion, your verdict1 ought to be for the defendants. Verdict accordingly, and judgment for defendants.  Dunlap, on .behalf of the plaintiffs in error, contended that the court below had erred in charging the jury. 1. That the facts justified the presumption of a license or grant to use the invention, and that defendants were protected thereby, independent of any act of Congress. 2. That the words,  specific machine,  in the 4th section of the act of 1839, referred to the invention its,elf, and that the authority to use it before the patent carried the right to continue to make and us  it after the patent had issued.\n",

      "judges:   parties:  Joseph Shaw, plaintiff in error v. Joseph Cooper. opinions:  Mr Justice M Lean delivered the opinion of the Court.. This writ of error brings before this court, for its revision, a judgment of the- circuit court of the United States for the southern district of New York. An action was brought in the circuit court by Shaw against the ^defendant Cooper, for the violation of a certain patent right, claimed by the plaintiff. The defendant pleaded the general issue, and. gave notice that on the trial he would prove  that the pretended new and ugpful improvement in guns and fire arms, mentioned and referred to in the several counts in the declaration  also that the said pretended new and useful improvement, or the essential parts or portions thereof, or some or one of thepi, had been known and used in this country, vi: 5. in the city of New York and in. th,e city of Philadelphia, and in sundry other places in the United States, and in England, in France, and in other foreign countries, before the plaintiff s application for a patent as set forth in his declaration,  &c. On the trial, the following bill of exceptions was'taken:   to maintain the issue joined, the. plaintiff, gave in evicjbnce certain letters patent of the United States, as set forth in the declaration, issued on the 7th day of May 1829  and also that the improvement for which' the letters were granted, was invented or discovered by the plaintiff in 1813 or 1814 and that the defendant had sold instruments which were infringements of-the said letters patent.   And the defendant then proved, by the testimony of one witness, that he had used the said improvement in England, .and had purcfiased a gun of the kind there, and had seen others use the said'improvement, and had seen guns of the kind in the dulce of York s armoury in 1819.' And also proved by the testimony of five other witnesses, that, in 1820 and 1821, they worked in England at the business of making and repairing guns, and-that the '-said improyeinent was generally used in England in. those years  but that they had never seen guns of the kind prior to those years: and also proved that in the year 1821, it was used and known in France   and also' that the said improvement was generally known and used in the United States after the 19th day of June. 1822.   And the plaintiff, further to maintain the issue on his part, then gave in evidence, that he not being a worker in iron in 1813 or 1814, employed his brother in England, under strict injunctions of secrecy, to execute or fabricate the said improvement for the purpose of making experiments. And that the plaintiff afterwards, in 1817, left England and came to reside in the United States  and that after his departure from England, in 1817 or 1818, his said brother divulged the secret for   certain reward to an eminent gjm maker in-London. That on the arrival of the plaintiff in this country, in 1817, he disclosed his said improvement to a gun maker, whom he consulted as to obtaining a patent for the. same  and whom he wished to engage to join .and assist him. That the plaintiff made this disclosure under injunctions of secrecy, churning the improvement as his own,' declaring that he should patent it. That the plaintiff treated his invention as a secret after his arrival in this country, often declaring that he should patent it  and that this step was only delayed, that he. might' make it more perfect before it was introduced into public Use: and that he did make alterations which some witnesses considered improvements in his invention, and others did not.' That in this country the invention was never known nor used prior to the said 19 th day of June 1822'  that ori that day letters patent were issued to the- plaintiff, being then an alien, and that he  mm .diately brought his invention into public use. That after-wards, and after suits had been brought for a violation of the said letters patent, the plaintiff was advised to surrender them on account of the specification being defective  and that'he did accordifigly, on the 7th day of May in the year 1829, surrender the same into the department of the secretary of state, and deceived the letters patent first above named.'   Arid the plaintiff also gave in evidence, that prior to the 19th day of Jun  1822, the principal importers of guns from England in New York and Philadelphia, at the latter of which cities the plaintiff resided, had never heard any thing of the said invention, or that the same was used or. known in England   and that no guns of the kind were, imported into this country, until in the years 1824 or 1825. And that letters patent were granted in England.on the 11 th day of April 1807, to one Alexander J. Forsyth, for a method of discharging or giving fire to artillery and all other fire arms  which method he describes in his specification as consisting in the use or application as a priming, in any mode, .of some or ope of those chemical compounds which are so easily inflammable as to.be capable of taking fire and exploding without any actual fire being applied thereto, and merely by a blow, or by any sudden or strong pressure or friction given or applied thereto, without extraordinary violence  that is to say, some one of the compounds of combustible matter, such as sulphur or sulphur and charcoal, with an oxmuriatic salt  for example, the salt formed of dephlogisticated marine acid and potash (or potasse), which salt is otherwise called oxmuriate of potash  or such of the fulminating metallic compounds as may be used With safety  for example, fulminating mercury, or of common-gunpowder mixed in due quantity with any of the above mentioned substances, or with any oxmuriatic salt  as aforesaid, or of suitable mixtures of any of. the before mentioned compounds  and that the said letters patent continued in force for the period of fourteen years from the time of granting the same.  And the defendant, further to maintain the issue on his part, gave in evidence a certain letter, from the plaintiff to the defendant, dated in December in the year 1824, from which the following is an extract:  some time since I stated that I had employed counsel respecting tegular prosecutions for any trespass against my rights to the patent  I have at length obtained the opinion of Mr Sergeant of this city, together with others eminent in the law, and that is, that I ought (with a view to insure success) to visit. England, and procure the affidavits, of Mant n and others,' to whom I made my invention known, and also of the person whom I employed to make the lock at the time of invention  for it appears very essential that I should' prove that' I did actually reduce the principle to practice, otherwise a verdict might he doubtful. It is, therefore, my intention to visit England in May next for this purpose  in the mean time proceedings which have commenced here are suspended for the necessary time:  And the court, on these facts, charged the jury that the patent of the 7th of May 1829, having been issued, as appears by its recital, on the surrender and cancelment of. the patent, of the 19th day of June in the year 1822  and being intended to correct a mistake or - remedy a defect in the latter  it must be considered as a continuation of the said patent, and the rights of the plaintiff weie to be determined by the state of things' which existed in the year 1822, when the patent was first obtained. That the plaintiff s case, therefore, came under the act passed the 17th day of April 1800, extending the right of obtaining patents to aliens  by the first section of which the applicant is required' to make oath, that his invention has not, tq the best of his knowledge or belief, been known or used in this or any foreign country. That the plaintiff most probably did not know, in the year 1822, that the invention for which he was taking out a patent, had, before that time, been in use in a foreign country  but that his knowledge or ignorance on that subject was rendered immaterial by the concluding part of the section, which expressly declares, that every patent obtained pursuant to that act, for any invention which it should afterward appear had been known or used previous to such application for a patent, should be utterly void. That there was nothing in the act confining such use to the United States  and that, if the invention was previously known in England or France, it was sufficient to avoid the patent under that act. That the evidence would lead to the conclusion that the plaintiff was the inventor in this case, bui the court were of opinion that he had slept too long on his rights, and not followed them up as the law requires, to entitle him to any benefit from his patent. That the use of the invention, by a person .who had pirated it, or by others who knew of the piracy, would not affect the inventor s rights, but that the law was made for the benefit of the public as well as of the inventor  and if, as appears from the evidence in this case* the public had fairly become possessed of the invention before the plaintiff applied for his patent, it was sufficient, in the opinion of the court, to invalidate the patent  even though the invention  may have originally got into public use through, the fraud or misconduct of his brother, to whom he entrusted the knowledge of it. Under this charge the jury found a verdict for the defendant, on which a judgment was entered. There is a. general assignment of errors, which brings to the Consideration of the court the principles of law which arise out of the facts, of the case, as stated in the bill of exceptions. It may be proper, in the first place, to inquire whether the letters patent which were obtained in 1839, on a surrender of the first patent, have relation to the emanation of the patent in 1833, or shall be considered as haying been issued on an original application. On the part of the plaintiff it is contended, that  the second patent is original and independent, and not a continuation of the first patent.  That in adopting the policy of giving, for a term of years, exclusive rights to inventors in this country, we adopted at the same time the rules of the common law as applied to patents in England: and that by the common law, a.patent when defective may be surrendered to the granting, power, which vacates the right under it,, and the Icing may grant the right de novo either to the same or to any other person. This being the effect of the surrender of a patent in England, it is insisted, that the same consequence should follow a surrender in this country. On this subject it is said, that the decisions of' the English courts are uniform, and that not even .a dictum'can be found, that a second patent is a continuation of the first. The counsel seems to consider this point of great importance, as the plaintiff was an alien when the first, patent was obtained, but had become naturalized before the date of the second'  and, consequently, that his rights under the second patent, cannot be governed by the law applicable to aliens. As the inquiry oil this head is, whether the second patent has relation to the first, it  3 not necessary to look into the laws to ascertain the respective rights of aliens and citizens on this subject. In regard' to the right of the patentee to surrender a defective pateht, and take out a new one   there can be no difference between a citizen and an alien. That the holder of a defective patent may surrender it to the department of state, and obtain a new one, which shall have relation to the emanation of the first, was decided by this court at the last term in the case of Grant and others v. Raymond, 6 Peters, 220. The chief justice, in giving the. opinion of the court, says,   but the new patent, and the proceedings on which it issues, have relation to the original transaction. The time of the privilege still runs from the date of the original patent. The application may be considered as appended to the original application   and if the new patent is valid, the law must be considered as satisfied, if the machine was not known or used before that application.  As this decision must be considered as settling the construction of the patent laws on this point, it is conclusive in the present case: and it is therefore unnecessary to examine the argument of the plaintiff s counsel, which was designed to lead to a different conclusion. The second patent being a continuation of the first one, the rights of the plaintiff must be ascertained by the law under which the original application was made. This law was passed on. the 17th of April 1800, and provides   that all and singular the rights and privileges given to citizens of the United States respecting patents for new inventions, &c. shall be extended to aliens, who, at the time-of petitioning, shall have resided for two years within the United States, &c. Provided, that every person petitioning for a patent for any invention, art or discovery, pursuant to this act, shall make oath or affirmation before some person duly authorized to administer oaths, before such patent shall be granted, that such invention, art or discovery, hath not, to the best of his or her knowledge or belief, been known or used, either in this or any foreign country  and that every patent which shall be obtained pursuant to this act, for any invention, art or discovery, which it shall afterwards appear had been known or used previous to such application for a patent, shall be utterly void.  By the act of the 21st of February 1793, which limits patent rights to citizens, it is provided   that every person or persons, in his or their application for a patent, shall-state that- the machine, &c. was not known or used before such application.  The sixth section of this act provides that a defendant, when prosecuted for a violation of a patent right, may give in evidence, under a notice, among other matters,   that the thing secured by patent was not originally discovered by the patentee, but had been in use, or had been described in some public work anterior to the supposed discovery of the patentee, or that he had surreptitiously obtained a patent for the discovery of another,person: in either of which cases, judgment shall be rendered for the defendant with costs, and the patent shall be declared void.  It would seem, from the above provisions, that citizens and aliens, as to, patent rights, are placed substantially upon the same ground. In either case, if the invention was known oi 'Used by the public before it was patented, the patent is void. In both cases the right must be tested by the same rule. From the facts. in the case, it appears that the plaintiff, 'yhile residing' in England, in 1813 or 1814, invented the instrument secured by his patent. That before he came to. the United Stat s, he made known his invention to his brother  to Mr Mant n, a gun maker in London, and to others. That shortly after he came to the United States, in 1817, he disclosed his .invention to a  gun maker in Philadelphia, and that in 1817 or 1818, the plaintiff s brother sold the invention to a gun maker tin London. That in 1819 the invention was sold and used in England  and that in the two following years it was in. public use there, and in the latter year also in France. That on the 19th of June 1822, his first patent was obtained. It also appears that in April 1807, a patent was granted in England to one Forsyth for fourteen years, for an invention on the same subject. This fact was shown by the plaintiff, it is presumed, as a reason why he did not take out a patent in England. The question arises from these facts, and others which belong to the case, whether there was such a u^e, in the public, of this invention, at the date of the plaintiff s first patent, as to render it void.. By the plaintiff s counsel it is' insisted, that if an invention has been pirated, or fraudulently divulged, the inventor cannot thereby lose his right to his own invention and property  and it makes no difference that the public have acquired the use of the invention without any participation in the fraud, unless the inventor has acquiesced in such use. The right of the plaintiff to his invention, is compared to his right to other property, which cannot be divested by fraud or violence  and the case of Miller v. Taylor, 4 Burr. 2303, where seven judges against four-held, that at common law, an author, by publishing a literary composition, does not abandon his right, is referred to as illustrative of the principle. Several decisions by the circuit courts of the United States are cited to sustain the right of the plaintiff. In the case, of Whittemore v. Cutter, 1 Gall. 482, the court say,  it will not protect the plaintiff s patent, that he was the inventor of the improvements, if he suffered them to be used freely and fully by the public at large for so- many years, combined with all the usual machinery  for in such case, he must be deemed to have made a gift of them to the public, as much as a person who voluntarily opens his land as a highway, and suffers it to remain for a length of time devoted to public use.  In the case of Goodyear v. Matthews, 1 Paine s Rep. 301, the court, in substance, say,   that if the plaintiff be the inventor, it is immaterial that the invention has been known and used for years before the application.  And in the case of Morris v. Huntington, 1.Paine, 354, the court- say, that  no man is to be permitted to lie by for years, and then take out a patent. If he has been practising his invention with a view of improving it, and thereby rendering it a greater benefit to the public, before taking out a patent, that ought not to prejudice-him. But it should always be a question submitted to the jury, what was the intent of the delay of the patent, and whether the allowing the invention to be used without * patent, should not be considered an abandonment .or present of it to the public.  This was a case where* second patent had been obtained,, the first being defective, and this, it would seem, was deemed sufficient to protect the right of the plaintiff, though- the public had been in possession of the invention for six years before the emanation of the second patent. Of the same import are the cases cited from 4 Mason, 108  and 4 Washington, 438 and 703.- The question what use in the public before the application is made for a patent, shall make void the right of the patentee, was brought before this court by the case of Pennock and Sellars v. Dialogue, reported in 2 Peters, 1. In this case the court say that   it has not been, and indeed cannot be denied, that an inventor may abandon his invention and surrender or dedicate it. to the public. This inchoate right, thus gone, cannot afterwards be resumed at his pleasure  for when gifts are once made to the public in this way, they become absolute.  And again,   if an invention is used by the public, with the consent of the inventor, at the time of his application fot a patent  how can the court say/ that his cas  is nevertheless rauch as the act was intended to protect 1 If such a public use is not a use within the meaning of the statute  how can the court extract the case from its operation, and support a patent, when the suggestions of the patentee were not true  and the conditions, oh which alone the grant was authorized, do not exist.    The true construction of the patent law is,  the court say,  f that the first inventor cannot acquire a good title to a patent, if he suffers the thing invented to go into public use, or to be publicly sold for use before he makes application for a patent.  In this case it appeared that the. thing invented had been in use by {he public, with the consent of the inventors, and through which they derived a profit, for seven years before the emanation of a patent. And this use was held by the court to be an abandonment of the right by the patentees. , The policy of granting exclusive privileges in certain cases, was deemed of so much importance in a national point of view, that power was given to congress in the federal constitution,   to promote the progress of science and useful arts, by securing for limited times, to authors and inventors, the exclusive right to'th ir respective writings and discoveries. . This power was exercised by congress, in the passage of the acts which have been referred to. And from an examination of their various provisions.-it clearly appears, that it was the intention of the legislature, by a compliance with the requisites of the law, to vest the exclusive fight in the inventor only  and that on condition, that his invention was neither known nor used by the public, before his application for a patent.. If such use or knowledge shall be proved to have existed, prior to the application for the patent, the act of 1793 declares the patent void  and as has been already stated, the right of an alien is vacated in the sam  manner, by proving a foreign use or knowledge of his invention. That knowledge or use which would be fatal to the patent right of a citizen, would be equally so to the right of an alien.. The knowledge or use spoken of in the act of 1793, could havte referred to the public only, for the provision would be nugatory if it were applied to the inventor himself. He must, necessarily, have a perfect knowledge of the thing invented and its use, before.he can describe it, as bylaw he is required to do, preparatory to the emanation of a patent. But there may be cases, in which a knowledge of the invention may be surreptitiously obtained and communicated to the public, that do not affect the-right of the inventor. Under such circumstances no presumption can arise infavour of an abandonment of the right to the public, by the inventor  though an acquiescence oil his part, will lay the foundation for such a presumption. In England it has been decided that if an inventor shall suffer the thing invented to be sold,, and go into public us  for four months  and in a later case for any period of time, before the date of his patent  it is utterly void. In that country the right emanates from the royal prerogative   in this, it is founded exclusively on statutory provisions. But the policy in both governments is the same, in granting the right, and in fixing its limits. Vigilance is necessaiy to entitle an individual to the privileges secured under the patent law. It is not enough that he should show his right by invention, but he must secure it in the mode required by law. And if the invention, through fraudulent means, shall be made known to the public, he should assert his right immediately, and take the necessary steps' tq legalize it. The patent lav/ was designed for the public benefit, as well as for the benefit of inventors. For a valuable invention, the public, on the inventor- s complying with certain conditions, give him, for   limited period, the profits arising from the sale of the thing invented.' This holds out an inducement for the exercise of genius and skill in making discoveries which may be useful to society, and profitable to the discoverer. But. it was not the'intention of this law, to take from the public, that of which they were fairly in possession. In the progress of society, the range of discoveries in the mechanic arts, in science, and in all things which promote the public convenience, as a matter of course, will be enlarged. This results from the aggregation of mind, and the diversity of talents and pursuits,.which exist in every intelligent community. And it would be extremely impolitic to retard or embarrass this advance, by withdrawing from the public any useful invention or art, and making it a subject of private monopoly. Against this consequence, the legislature have carefully guarded in the laws they have passed on the subject. It is'undoubtedly j st that every discoverer should realize the benefits resulting from his discovery, for the period contemplated by law. But these can only be secured by a substantial compliance with every legal requisite. His exclusive right does not rest alone upon his discovery  but also upon the legal sanctions which have been given to it, and the forms of law with which it has been clothed. No matter by what means an invention 'may be communicated to the public  before a patent is obtained  any acquiescence in the public use, by the inventor, will be an abandonment of his right. If the right  were asserted by him who fraudulently obtained it, perhaps no lapse of time could give it validity. ' But the public stand in an entirely different relation to the inventor. The. invention passes into the possession of innocent persons, who have no knowledge of the fraud, and at a considerable expense, perhaps, they appropriate it to. their own use. The inventor or his agent has full knowledge of these facts, but fails to assert his right: shall he afterwards be permitted to assert it with effect 1 Is ncrt this such evidence of acquiescence in the public, use, on his part, as justly forfeits his right? If an individual witness a sale and transfer of real estate, under certain circumstances, in which he has an equitable lien or interest, and does not make known this interest, he shall not afterwards be permitted to assert it. On this principle it is, that a discoverer-abandons his right, if, before the obtainment of his patent, his discovery goes into public use  His right would be secured by giving public notice that he was the inventor of the thing used, and that he should apply for a patent. Does this impose any thing more than reasonable diligence on the inventor % And would any thing short of this, be just to the public ? The acquiescence of an inventor in the public use of his invention, can in no case be presumed, where he has no knowledge of such use. But this knowledge may be presumed from the circumstances of the case. This will, in general, be a fact for the jury. And if the inventor do not, immediately after this notice, assert his right, it is such evidence of acquiescence in the public use, as for ever afterwards to prevent him from asserting it. After his right shall be perfected by a patent, no presumption arises against it from a subsequent use by the public. When an inventor applies to the department of state for a patent, he should state the facts truly  and indeed 'he is-required to do so, under the solemn obligations of an oath. -If his invention has been carried into public use by fraud  but for a series of months or years, he has taken no steps to assert his right  would not this afford such evidence of acquiescence as to defeat his application, as effectually, as if he failed tos ate that he was the original inventor ? And the same evidence which should defeat his application for a patent, would,, at any subsequent period, .be fatal to his right. The evidence he exhibits to the department of state is not only ex parte, but interested   .and the questions of fact are left open, to be controverted by any one who shall think proper to contest the right under the patent.. A strict construction of the act, as it regards the public use of an invention, before it is patented, is not only required by its letter and spirit, but also by. sound policy. A terna of fourteen years was deemed sufficient for the enjoyment of an exclusive right of an invention by the inventor  but if h  may delay an application for his patent, at pleasure, although his invention be carried into public use, he may extend the period beyond what the law intended to give him.- A pretence of fraud would afford no adequate security to the public in this respect, as artifice might be used to cover the transaction. The doctrine of presumed acquiescence, where the public use is known, or might be known to the inventor, is the only safe rule which can be adopted on this subject. In the case under consideration it appears the plaintiff came to this country, from England, in the year 1817, and being an alien, he could not apply for   patent until he had remained in the country two years. There was no legal obstruction tp hisobtaining a patent in the year 1819  but it seems that he failed to apply-for one, until three years liter he might have done so. Had he used proper diligence U. this Aspect his right might have been secured  as his invention was not sold in England until the year 1819. But, in the two following years, it is proved to have been in public use th  re, and in the latter year, also in France. Under such circumstances, can the plaintiff s right be sustained ? His counsel assigns as a reason for riot making an earlier application, that he was endeavouring to make his invention more perfect  but it seems by this delay, he was not enabled, essentially, to vary or improve it  The plan is substantially the Same as was carried into public use through the brother of the plaintiff, in England. Such an excuse, therefore, cannot avail the plaintiff. For three years, before the emanation of his patent, his invention was in public 'use, and he appears to have taken no step to assert his right. Indeed he sets up, as..a part of his case, the patent to Forsythe, as a reason why he did not apply for a patent in England. . The Forsythe patent was dated six years before. Some of the decisions of the circuit courts, which are referred to, were rverruled in the. case of Pennock  nd . Sellers v. Dialogue. They made the. question of abandonment to turn upon the intention of the inventor. But such is not considered to be the true ground. Whatever, may be the intention of the inventor, if he suffers his invention to gp into public use, through any means whatsoever, without an immediate assertion of his right, he is not entitled to a patentnor will a patent, obtained under such circumstances, protect his right. The judgment of the circuit court must be affirmed With costs   This-cause came on to be heard on the transcript  of the record from the circuit court of the United States for the southern district of New York, and was argued by counsel: on consideration whereof, it is adjudged and ordered by this court, that the judgment of the said circuit court in this cause fee, and the same is hereby affirmed with costs  attorneys:  The case was submitted to the court, on printed arguments, by Mr Paine, for the plaintiff in error  And Mr Emmet, for the defendant.

Joseph Cooper. ction for an alleged violation of a patent for an improvement in guns and fire arms. he letters patent were obtained in 1822  and in 1829, the patentee having surrendered the same for an alleged defect in the specification, obtained another patent. This second patent is to be Considered as having relation to the emanation of the patent of 1822  and not as having been issued on an original application. The holder of a defective patent may surrender.it to the department of state, and obtain a new one, which shall have relation to the emanation of the first. The case of Grant and others v. Raymond, 6 Peters, 220, cited and affirmed. A second patent granted on the surrender of a prior one being a continuation of the first, the rights of a patentee must be ascertained by the. law under which the original application was made. Ry the provisions _of the act of congress of 17th April 1800, citizens and aliens, as to patent rights, are placed substantially upon the same ground. In either case, if the invention was known or used by the public before it was. patented, the patent is. void. In both cases, the right must be tested by the same rule. What use by the public, before the application is made for a patent,.shall make void the right of a patentee. From an examination of the various provisions of the acts of congress rela- ' tive to patents for useful inventions, it clearly appears that, it was the intention of the legislature, by a compliance with the requisites of the law, to vest the exclusive right in the inventor only  and that, on condition that his invention was neither known nor used by the public, before his   application for a patent. If such use or knowledge shall be proved to-have existed prior to the application for the patent, the act of 1793 dedares the patent void  and the right of an alien is vacated in the same manner, by proving a foreign use or knowledge of his invention. That knowledge or use which would be fatal to the patent right of a citizen, would be equally so to. the right of an alien. The knowledge or use spoken of in the act of congress of 1793  could have referred to the public only  for the provision would be nugatory if it were applied to the inventor himself. He must necessarily-have a perfect knowledge of the thing invented, and of its use, before he can describe it, as by law he is required to do preparatory to the emanation of a patent. There may be cases in which acknowledge of the invention may be surreptitiously obtained and communicated to the public, that do not affect the right of the inventor. .Under such circumstances, no presumption can arise in favour of an abandonment of the right to the public by the inventor: though an acquiescence on his part will lay the foundation for, such a presumption. It is undoubtedly just that every discoverer should realize the benefits resulting from his. discovery, for the period contemplated by law. But those can only be' reserved by a substantial compliance with every legal requisite. This exclusive right does not rest alone on his discovery, but also uponrth'e legal sanctions which.have been given to it, and the forms of law with which it has been clothed.  No matter by .what means an invention may have been communicated to the public before a patent is obtained, any acquiescence in the public use by the inventor will be an abandonment of the right. If the. right were asserted by him who. fraudulently obtained it, perhaps no lapse of time could give it validity. But the public stand in- an entirely different   relation to the inventor. His right would be secured by giving public, notice that he was the inventor of the thing used, and. that he should apply for a patent. The acquiescence of an inventor in the public use of his invention, can in ni> case be presumed where he has no knowledge of such use. But this knowledge may be presumed from the circumstances of the case. This will in general be a fact for a jury: and if the inventor do not, immediately after this notice, assert his right, it is such evidence of acquiescence in the public use, as forever afterwards to prevent him from asserting it. After Jus right shall be perfected by a patent, no presumption arises against it from a subsequent use by the public. A strict construction of the act of congress, as it regards the public use of .an invention before .it is patented, is not only required by its letter and spirit, but also by sound policy.. The question of abandonment to the public, does not depend on the inten'tion of the inventor. Whatever may be the intention, if he suffers his invention to go into public use, through any means whatsoever, .without an immediate assertion of his right, he is not entitled to a patent  nor will a patent obtained under such.circumstances protect his right. IN error to the circuit court of the United States for the southern district of New York. At the October term 1829 of the circuit court for the southern district of New York, the plaintiff in error, Joseph Shaw, instituted an action against the defendant, Joseph Cooper, for an alleged violation of a patent granted to him by the United' States, dated the 7th of Mdy 1829, .for   a new and useful improvement in guns and fire aims, which improvement consisted in a priming head and case applied to arms and- fire arms, for.the purpose of priming and giving them fire by the' means or use of percussion, fulminating or detonating powder by which patent the plaintiff alleged that there was granted to him, &c. for the term of fourteen years from the 19th of -June-1822, the exclusive right to the said invention, and by virtue of which he became entitled to the same for the residue of t re term unexpiied on the 7th day of May 1829. The declaration averred that the defendant had violated the patent right of the plaintiff, on the 1st day of August 1829  and afterwards between that , day and the institution of the suit. The defendant pleaded not guilty, and gave the following notice of the matters of defence.   Please to take notice, that on the trial of the above cause, the above named Joseph' Cooper will, under the plea of the general issue aforesaid, insist upon, and give in evidence, that the pretended new and useful improvement in guns and fire arms, mentioned and referred to in the several counts of the said Joshua Shaw s declaration, was not originally discovered or invented by the said Joshua Shaw  also, that the said pretended new and useful improvement, or the material or essential parts or portions thereof, or some or One of them, had been known and used in this country, viz. in the city of New York, and in the city of Philadelphia, and in sundry other places in the United States, and in England, and in France, and in other foreign countries, before the said Joshua Shaw s application for a patent, as set forth in his said declaration  and also, before the alleged invention or supposed discovery thereof by the said Joshua Shaw.   And further, that the said alleged new and useful improvement, or the material or essential parts or portions thereof, or some or one of them, or the principle thereof, was the invention or discovery of a gun maker, or of some other person, residing in England. And further, that tbe said patent was void, because in and by the specification or description therein referred to, no distinction or discrimination is made between the parts and portions previously known and used as aforesaid, and any parts or portions of which the said Joshua Shaw may be the inventor or discoverer: the said Joseph Cooper at the same time protesting that he, the said Joshua Shaw, has not been the inventor or discoverer of any part or portion of the said alleged improvement.   And further, that the said patent is void, because the said specification or description does not describe the improvement of which the said Joshua Shaw claims t  be the ihvent r or discoverer, in such full, clear, and exact terms, as to distinguish the sa ne from all other things before known, nor so as to enable a person skilled in the art or science of which it is a branch, or with which it is most nearly connected, to make and use the same. And further, that the said patent is void, because, it was not granted,.issued or obtained, according to law. And further, that the said patent is void, because it was surreptitiously obtained by the said Joshua Shaw.?  The cause was tried in January 1832, and a verdict' and judgment given for the defendant. The plaintiff prosecuted this writ of error. The following bill of exceptions was tendered by the counsel for the plaintiff and sealed by the' court.   The plaintiff, to maintain the issue on his grant  gave in evidence the letters patent of the United States of America, as set forth in the declaration of the said plaintiff, issued on the 7th day of May 1829  and also that the improvement, for which the said letters patent were granted, was. invented or discovered by the said plaintiff in the year 1813 or 1814, and that the defendant had sold instruments which were infringements of the said letters patent. And thereupon the said defendant, to maintain the said issue above joined on his. part,then and there proved by the testimony of one witness, that he had used the said improvement in England, and had purchased a g n of the kind there, and had seen others use the said improvement, and had seen guns of the kind in the duke of York s armoury in 1819 : and also proved by the testimony of five other witnesses, that, in 182  and 1821, they worked in England at the business of making and repairing guns, and that the said improvement was generally used in England'in those years, but that they never had s en' guns of the kind prior to those years: and also proved that, in 1821, it was known and used in France, and also that the said improvement was generally known and used in the United States of America after the 19th day of June 1822. Whereupon the  aid plaintiff, further to maintain the said issue on his part, then and there gave in evidence, that the said plaintiff, not being a worker in iron in 1813 or 1814, employed his brother, in England, under strict injunctions of secrecy, to execute or fabricate the said improvement for the purpose of the said plaintiffs making experiments.- And that the said plaintiff, afterwards, in 1817, left. England, and came to reside in the United States of America: and that, after the departure of the said plaintiff from- England, viz. in 1817  r 1818, his said brother divulged the said secret for a certain reward to an eminent gun maker in London: that the said plaintiff on his arrival in this country, in 1817, disclosed his said improvement to a gun maker, whom he consulted as to obtaining a patent for the same, and whom he wished to engage to join and assist him. That the plaintiff made said disclosures under injunctions of secrecy, claiming the improvement as his own, and declaring that he should patent it. That the said plaintiff, treated his invention as a secret after his arrival in this country, often declaring that he should patent it  and that he assigned as a reason for delaying to patent it, that it was not so perfect as he wished to make it before he introduced' it into public use: and that he did make alterations in his invention up to about the date-of .his patent, which some witnesses considered as improvements, and others did not. That, in this country, the said invention was never known nor used prior to the said 19th day of June 1822: that, on that day, letters patent were issued to the said plaintiff, being then an alien, for his said invention  and that the said plaintiff immediately brought the said invention into public use under the said let-, ters patent. That afterwards, and after suits had been brought for violation of the said letters patent, the- said plaintiff was advised to surrender them on account of the specification being   defective, and that he did accordingly, on the 7th day of May 1829, surrender the same into the department of the secretary of state of the United States of America  and that, thereupon, the letters patent first above mentioned were issued to the said plaintiff. And . the said plaintiff also gave in evidence that, prioCtOxtfre said 19th day of June 1822, the principal importers of guns from England, in New York and Philadelphia, at the latter of which cities the plaintiff resided, had never heard any thing, of the said- invention, or that the same was known or vised in England  and .that no guns of the kind were imported into this country until in the years 1824 or 1825. And that letters patent were granted in England on the 11th day of April 1807, to one Alexander J. Forsyth, for a method of discharging or giving fire to artillery, and all other fire arms  which method he describes in his specification as consisting in   the use or application as a priming, in any mode, of some or one of those chemical compounds which are so easily inflammable as to.be capable of taking fire and exploding without any actual fire being applied thereto, and merely by a blow, or by any sudden or strong pressure or friction given or applied thereto, without extraordinary violence  that is to say, some one of the compounds of combustible matter, such as sulphur or sulphur and charcoal, with an oxmuriatic salt  for example, the salt formed of dephlogisticated marine acid and potash (or potasse), which salt is otherwise called oxmuriate of potash  or such of the fulminating metallic compounds as may be used with safety  for example, fulminating mercury, or of common gunpowder, mixed in due quantity with any of the above mentioned substances, or with any oxmuriatic salt as aforesaid, or of suitable mixtures of any of the before mentioned compoundsand that the said letters patent continued in force for the period of fourteen years from and after granting of the same. (It is understood that the patent and specification of Forsyth, may be at any time referred to on the arguriient for correction or explanation of the bill of exceptions.) And thereupon the defendant, further to maintain the said issue on his part, gave in  vidence a certain letter from the plaintiff to the defendant, dated in December 1824, from which the following  3 an extract :   some time since I stated that I had employed counsel' respecting regular prosecutions for any trespasses against my rights to th  patent: I have at length obtained the opinions of Mr Sergeant of this city, together with others eminent in law, and that is, that I ought (with a view to insure success) to visit England, and procure the affidavits of Mant n and others to whom I made my invention known, and also of the person whom I employed to make the lock at the time of invention  for it appears very essential that I should also prove that I did actually redude the principle to practice, otherwise a verdict might be' doubtful. It is therefore my intention to visit England in May next for this purpose  in the mean time, proceedings which have. commenced here are suspended for the necessary time.   .And the said judges of the said court did thereupon charge and direct the said jury,, that the patent of the 7th day of May 1829, having been issued, as appeared by its recital on the surrender and concealment of the patent of the 19th day of June 1822  and being intended to correct a mistake o r remedy a defect in the latter, it must'be considered as a continuation of the said patent, and the rights of the plaintiff were to be determined by the state of things which existed in 1822, when the patent was obtained.  That the plaintiff s case therefore came under the act passed the 17th day of April 1800, extending the right of obtaining patents to aliens, by the first section of which, the applicant is required to make oath that his invention has not, to the best of his knowledge or belief, been known or used in this or any foreign country. That the plaintiff most probably did not know, in 1822, that the invention for which he was taking but a patent, had, before that time, been in  se in a foreign country  but that his knowledge or ignorance on that subject was rendered immaterial by the concluding part of the section, which expressly declares, that every patent obtained pursuant to that act, for any invention which it should afterwards appear had been known or used previous to such application for a patent, should be utterly void. That there was nothing in the act confining such use to the United . States  and that, if the invention was previously known in England or Prance, it was sufhcient to avoid the patent under that' act. That the evidence would lead to the conclusion that the plaintiff was the inventor in this case  but the court were of opinion that he had slept too long on his rights, and not followed them up as the law requires, to entitle him to any benefit from his patent. That the use of the invention, by a person who had pir fed it, or by others who knew of the piracy, would not affect the inventor s rights, but that the law was made for the benefit of the public as well as of the inventor: arid if, as appeared from the evidence'in this case, the p blic had f irly become possessed of the invention before plaintiff applied for his patent, it was sufficient, in the opinion of the court, to invalidate his patent, even though the invention may have originally got into public use through the fraud or misconduct of his brother, to whom he entrusted the knowledge of it.  The case was submitted to the court, on printed arguments, by Mr Paine, for the plaintiff in error  And Mr Emmet, for the defendant. For the plaintiff in error it was contended, that the case fell within the principles whi h had been uniformly acknowledged and supported in the circuit court of the United States  and which were not intended to be disavowed, but sanctioned by this court in Pennock v. Dialogue, % Peters, 1. In this country many strong pases of public use, prior to the application for a patent, have been brought before the courts, where the public had been long in possession  and the courts have allowed the inventor to show in different ways, that he had not thereby abandoned his use to the public. How much more favourable to us are the circumstances of our case, as respects a prior use. Before we took out our first patent, the invention had never been seen nor heard of in this country. It was not then known to ourselves, nor to any others in this country, that it had been used in England  and it had been so used only one or two years   a short period, compared, witn the many cases which have been sustained by the courts. Even if this use had been an American use, it would not have been an extraordinary one. But it was not an American, but a foreign use 'and, therefore, not a use by the. public,.who contest our exclusive right, by saying that they had become the innocent, possessors of our invention. Not one of that public had gotten possession of it. The case does not seem to be fairly stated, when it is said that, although the invention was disclosed by piracy, yet. the public have innocently got possession of it by that means. The only public who can set up the innocence of their possession as against us, did not get their possession by the piracy  but under, the invalid patent. And if this be-so, what difference does it make that afterwards guns were brought from England? Does such a circumstance bear, can it be made to bear at all upon the merits of the case T The parts of the charge to the jury of the circuit court which are objected to, as understood by the counsel for the plaintiff, may be stated thus: That the use of the invention abroad, acquired through a fraudulent or piratical disclosure of the secret, for a period of only one or two years, before the application for the patent, and that use entirely unknown to the inventor here, avoids the patent, because it was obtained under the alien act. That our patent of 1829, obtained under the citizen s act, is, in respect to the prior foreign use, to be construed as if obtained under the alien act, because it was obtained on the surrender of the patent of 1822, which was obtained under the alien act, the one being only a continuation of the other. That the inventor (the court are understood to have been speaking, in this part of the charge, without reference to the question as to whether the patent was obtained under the alien or citizen s act, but to have designed their remarks to apply to patents generally,) had slept too long on his rights, and not followed them up as the. law requires, to entitle him to any benefit from his patent  that the use of the invention, by a person who had pirated it, or by others who knew of the piracy, would not affect the inventor s right  but that the law was made for the benefit of the public, as well as of thp inventor  and if, as appeared from the evidenc  in this case, the public had fairly become possessed of the invention before the plaintiff applied for his patent, it was sufficient to invalidate his patent, even though the invention may have originally got into public use through the fraud or misconduct of his brother, to whom he intrusted the knowledge of it. The following points comprehend these objections to the charge of the court. . 1. The second patent is original and independent, and not a continuation of the first patent. When patents are surrendered and cancelled in England, they are entirely vacated and gone, and as if they had never existed  and the king can grant out the right, de novo, either to the same, or to any other person. 17 Vin. Abridg. 114, Prerogative of the King, R. b. paragraph 9  17 Vm. Abridg. 151, Prerogative, &c. M. C. paragraph 2, 3, 4, 6, 10, 14. Godson on Pat. 200  Com. Dig. 'Patent,  G. If this is the effect of a surrender there, it must be the same here. Not a dictum can be found in the English books, that a second patent is a continuation of the first. No such idea can be found in our own books, although cases of surrender have come before our courts. The right of an inventor to surrender an invalid patent, and take out a new one, being admitted, it follows, that if, between the two patents, he has been naturalized, he must, of necessity, take out a patent under the citizen s act  because he is no longer an alien. If he, rightfully, takes a patent under the citizen s act, he is entitled to all the advantages that act confers  and among them5 to have his patent construed and adjudicated upon, under the provisions of that act and of no other. 2. A fraudulent or piratical use of the invention, either at ho'me or abroad, before the application for a patent, cannot have any other or greater effect to invalidate a patent obtained under the alien act, than one obtained under the citizen s act. On general principles it cannot  for, as to all kinds of property, no one can acquire a right to it except by the consent of the owner. Theft or fraud can never enable one who gets possession by those means to transfer the property. See authorities cited under next point. It is on this principle that the courts first began to construe the citizen s act, by arraying the sixth section against the first. They said the legislature meant to provide by the sixth section for the exception of cases of fraud, &c., out of the too rigid and literal operation of the rst section. Afterwards, the courts took a more liberal view of the act, and held that, even without the sixth section, the legislative intention to except such cases from the first section would be presumed: and this is the doctrine finally settled in Pennock v. Dialogue. The construction given by this court in the case of Pennock v  Dialogue, 2 Peters, 22, is entirely in favour of the plaiptiflf in error. The court there say, in that case,  the act of.17th April 1800, ch. 25, which extends the privileges of the act of 1793 to inventors who are aliens, contains a proviso, declaring that  every patent which shall be obtained pursuant.to the act, for any invention, art or discovery, which it shall after-wards appear had been known or used previous to such application for a patent, shall be void.  This proviso certainly certifies the construction of the act of 1793, already asserted  for there is not any reason to suppose that the legislature intended to confer on aliens privileges essentially different from those belonging to citizens: on the contrary, the enacting clause of the act of 1800 purports to put both on the same footing, and the proviso seems added as a gloss, or explanation of the original act.  Now the proviso is the only thing in the alien act which can make it at all different in this particular from the citizen s act  and the courts say that it does not make any difference, but merely expresses more fully what was the meaning of the citizen s act. 3. If an invention has been pirated or fraudulently divulged, the inventor cannot thereby lose his right to his own invention and property  and it makes no difference that the public have acquired the use of the invention without any participation in the fraud, unless the inventor has acquiesced in such use   the only principle to be' found in the American decisions on this subject being, that a public use does, i pt affect the inventor s right, unless it proves that he has .'dedicated or abandoned his invention to the public. And in this case there is no evidence of such delay or neglect as would amount to an abandonment, nor of any intention to dedicate- the invention to the public. It is a general principle as to all kinds of personal property, that even a bona fide purchaser for a valuable consideration can never acquire property of which another has been deprived by fraud, theft or violence, or even by a bailment. 1 Wils. Rep. 8   2 Str. Rep. 1187  3 Atk. Rep. 44  Salk. Rep. 283. In this respect, no difference has ever yet been made between a man s property in his inventions, and his other property  and there seems to be no reason or principle making a distinction. The statute of Massachusetts securing copyrights (before the federal union) begins with a preamble declaring that   no property is more peculiarly a man s own, than that which is produced by the labour of his mind.  Cited, 1 Dane s Abridg. 527. In Miller v. Taylor, 4 Burr. 2303, seven judges against four held that at common law the author of a literary composition did-not lose his right by publishing it. So far, then, as the natural rights of men to this species of property, (copyright) independently of statutory provisions, are in question, they retain all their rights to such property, notwithstanding the public have innocently got possession of it, and even with the. author s consent  and there surely can be no difference, when we go back to natural rights at common law, whether the property is the subject of a copyright or of a patent  whether it be a book or a machine: the public, having got the use or possession, must have as much right to make copies of the book as of the machine  both are the produce of the mind. This view is taken merely to show that this species of property has been treated as subject to. the same rules of law as other kinds of property, i. e. except so far as the statute makes   difference. Now-it is admitted, that under the statute, neither the pirate, nor any one participating in his piracy, can acquire any rights against the inventor.- And why.? Because the same rules of justice' which apply to all other kinds of property, are applied by the courts to this, as being the intention of the statute, although against its letter. But why stop at the pirate, and say that you will not extend the rule to the public,' when they have, innocently got the possession? Do you stop thus as to other kinds of property? No. You say, no one, however innocent of the fraud, can become the lawful proprietor. Why, then, not carry the principle to its full extent? How can it be inferred that the statute intends to go a part of the way of a general principle, and there stop? The principle is a rule' drawn by analogy from other kinds of property, on the ground that, the analogy being general, the' rule should be so too. But the analogy is also complete between this and other kinds of property, and the rule ought therefore to be complete, and applied in its full extent. But there is even a stronger reason why this principle of law should be applied to this species of property in its full extent, rather than to the case of a bona fide purchaser of any other kind. There he has paid   consideration, an equivalent. It is a hard case  one of two innocent persons must suffer. Not so here. What does the public lose? That, which has cost it nothing  for which it has given no equivalent: and all we seek of them is the consideration, the equivalent, which they have never yet paid to any one. ' But if w  examine the American cases on this subject prior to Pennock v. Dialogue, we shall find that the principle has always been applied to inventions, in its full extent. The counsel then proceeded to examine the following cases, and argued that they fully sustained the principles claimed for the plaintiff in error. Whettemore v. Cutter, 1 Gall. 482  Goodyear , v. Mathews, 1 Paine s Rep. 301  Morris v. Huntington, 1 Paine 354  Mellers v. Silsbee, 4 Mason s Rep. 108  Treadwell v. Bladen, 4 Wash. C. C. R. 703. The bill of exceptions-says,  that the plaintiff assigned as a .reason for delaying to patent it (the invention), that it was not so perfect as he wished to make it before he introduced it to public use  and that he did make alterations in his invention Up to about the date of his patent, which some witnesses considered as improvements, and others did not.  This was sufficient to account for the delay  and it is unimportant whether the alterations were improvements or not  for he was trying to make them, and said that was his motive for the delay  and the motive for the delay is the only question. 1 Paine s Rep. 354. The patent granted t  Forsyth, in England, which gave him the exclusive right to use the percussion powders in any mode down to April 1821, accounts for our not taking out a patent in England. Finally, the counsel for the plaintiff in error .contended: 1. That if the rights of the patentee were the same as under am ordinary citizen patent, then he had never dedicated or abandoned his invention to the public .and that there has been no use of it which invalidates his patent. 2. That his' rights are the same as those under an ordinary citizen s patent  the patent having been granted under the citizen s act, and not being affected by the previous vacated patent. 3. Thai even if he is to be considered as having a patent under the alien act, his rights, tinder the circumstances of this case, are the same as if it was ,a citizen s patent. In conclusion, he remarked, that the jury found their verdict entirely under the charge of the court, considering that the charge, as to the points of law, precluded them frota finding a verdict for the plaintiff  however well they might be satisfied upon every matter of fact. It was believed the jury, as well as the court, were entirely satisfied that the plaintiff was the inventor, and that his invention had been used without his knowledge or suspicion  and that he had never disclosed it, except in confidence, and under the strictest injunctions of secrecy. The letter from plaintiff to defendant should not have been put in the bill of exceptions, because it only presented questions of fact purely, not affecting any of the points of law on which the court charged the. jury. This court will not regard a mere isolated fact, when it is apparent' that all the facts of the case are not given, but only such as are essential to show how the jury were charged as to the law. It is impossible for this court to say how the jury would have found upon the whole evidence. It is sufficient to add, that the meaning of that letter was satisfactorily explained to the jury by the plaintiff s counsel. It >vas explained, that the knowledge of his invention, yhich the.plaintiff in that letter says he communicated to   Mant n and others,  was simply the knowledge of the fact, that he had made an important invention, without disclosing what it was. On any other supposition, this letter was contradicted by aE the rest of the evidence in the case, and the uniform conduct of,the plaintiff. Mr Emmet, for the defendant in error. The bill of exceptions in this cause, discloses in substance the following case : In 1813 or 1814, the plaintiff, residing-in England, invented what he claims to be secured-to him by his patent. Between that time and his coming to the United States, he made his invention known to his brother, also to Mr Mant n, a gun-maker in London, and others   as is shown by his letter to defendant. In 1817, the plaintiff came to the United States, and shortly afterwards disclosed his secret to a gunmaker in Philadelphia. In 1817 or 1818, plaintiff s brother sold thececret to a gun maker in London. In 1819, the invention was sold and used'in England. In 1820 .or 1821, it was in general us  by the public ihere. In 1821, it was in general use in France. In.1822, (19th June), plaintiff took out his first patent as' an. alien, under the act of 1800. In 1829, (7th May), he surrendered that patentas defective, and took out a new one with an amended specification, as a citizen, under the act of 1793, upon which patent his suit is brought. The case also sets forth, that rn April 1807, a patent had been granted in England to one Forsyth, for an invention od the same subject, and that such patent continued in force fon fourteen years, or until April 1831. This was offered-byth  plaintiff, and made a part of the case, for the purpose, doubtless, of accounting for -his not having taken out a patent for his invention in England previous to 1817, the terms of Forsyth s patent being, as he supposed, sufficiently' comprehensive to embrace his discovery, and to tie up his hands during its continuance. From these facts, it would at least appear that the public had somewhere become fully possessed of the use of the invention, and that they had enjoyed such use for not less than about two  years before the plaintiff took any teps to obtain his first patent. Without stopping now to inquire what should be considered'' as the public in respect to a case of this kind, let us examine how,far the acts of' the plaintiff himself have precluded him from ever controverting the right of that public to the use of the thing m question. The principi  upon which previous public use of an invention invalidates a patent, undoubtedly is, that the inventor can no longer give atfy consideration or equivalent for the exclusive privilege claimed by him  and the law, to sustain a principle so necessary and just in itself, presumes an abandonment by .the inventor-. This abandonment may be either actual, as by voluntary dedication, or constructive, as by negligence or unreasonable delay. Paine s Rep. 300, In the present case, can it be pretended that there was neither negligence, nor .unreasonable delay ? The plaintiff would have it appear, that up to 1822 he was maturing his invention, and yet what he then took out a patent for, was the very thing, and no improvement upon that, which for two or three years previous had beeri generally known and used in England and France! But, admitting this explanation to stand for what it is worth, how. does it tally with his other ground, of excuse. He says Forsyth s patent restrained him. in England. Be it so   and what is the fair inference?- Why, that if it had not been for Forsyth s patent, he woulr  have applied there for one before 1817  and if he would, his invention was matured before he came to the United States  arid nothing tat his'alienism stood in the way of his applying for a patent immediately.after his. arrival. Being ari alien, the law required him to delay two years. -In 1819, therefore, he might and ought to have-taken out his patent  and if he had done so, he would have anticipated the public use of the invention in England -and France. But he delayed' until 1822, a period of three years. His own story shows that such delay was without sufficient cause. It was, therefore, unreasonable  and the law in protection of the right acquired in the mean time by the, public, construes his acts into an abandonment. It would appear that, even to the mind of the plaintiff s couns l, this view of the case is conclusive, -unless the fact of the invention having got into public use before the first patent was taken out, can -be shaken  for they say, that the use, in this ease, was mot an American, but a foreign use, and -therefore not a use by the public, , who contest their exclusive right. This distinction is directly opposed to the'act of 18 0, which Uses the language - known or used, in this or any foreign country:'  and it is equally opposed to the intent and meaning of the act of 1793.' We are perfectly willing to admit that..in thi3 respect, the construction of ,both acts skorild be the same  and that the proviso at the end of the first section of the act .of 1800 applies to every patent} whether obtained under that act or the act of 1793. In the words of Mr Justice Story, the act of 1800 affords, in this respect, a gloss or explanation of the original act. Pennock v. Dialogue, 2 Peters s S. C. Rep. 22. This only tends to show, that if the plaintiff had been a citizen in 1822, and had'taken out his first patent under the act of 1793, his case would have been just as objectionable as it is now. But where do the plaintiff s counsel -find any law for such a distinction between American and foreign public use, or how could it be sustained on principle? If the doctrine be a sound one, it would go to this extent   I dedicate my invention to the public in Europe  the European public being thus legally possessed of it, the article is manufactured and exported in large quantities .I immediately come over here, take out a patent, and prevent the use of the article in the United States, thereby prohibiting the European public from engaging in a traffic or. commerce which was an imm diate incident to iny own grant or dedication to them. The impolicy of recognizing such,a distinction, would afford   sufficient argument against it, even if the terms of the statute were not explicit  and if nothing had ever fallen from the bench to'give a construction to the expression  public use.  But there is positive and high authority on this subject. Lord Chief Justice Gibbs says,   to entitle a man to a  pateht, the invention must be new to the world.  1 Holt N. P. Rep. 58. And such, we submit, is the settled law on this point. It would seem to be of little importance in this cause.to discuss the .plaintiff s position   that the second patent is original and independent, and not a continuation of the first patent   because the only object of disconnecting the two patents in this case, vjould be to rescue the seeond patent from the operation of the act of 1800, under which the first patent was taken, (the judge having charged the jury that the act of 1800 was sufficient to control the case). Now, we not only admit that the act of 1793 should receive   similar construction with that of 1800, as to previous knowledge or- us  of an invention, but the  plaintiff s counsel labour to establish this very ground. Their position, however, is not a correct one. The object of canceling a first patent, and taking out a second, is not to take a fresh start for the term of years during which the law allows the exclusive right to be conferred. It is to enable the inventor to enjoy, for the remainder, of that term, the privilege which was originally intended .to be grained. And in this view, even if the construction of the two acts was different, we apprehend that the judge laid down the law correctly, viz. that the plaintiff s rights depended upon the state of things in 1822, and upon the act of 1800. It is only necessary to follow the plaintiff s argument on his third point, to perceive the impediment which the first section of the act of 1800, taken either in reference to that act only, or as explanatory, of the act of 1793, offers to his case. To get rid of this difficulty, it is in substance contended by his counsel, that the legislature did not mean, what they have said in this section, when certain cases came to be considered  and that tpe positive and unequivocal language used by them is, in this respect, unimportant. Now, the very fact that this section was intended, to be declaratory of the' law jn all cases, whether arising under that, or the former act of 1793, shows that the explicit language used, was considered to be all-important by the legislature  and it certainly was not contemplated that this explicit language should be frittered away to suit particular cases.. If the facts of this case, as. we have endeavoured to show, make out negligence or unreasonable delay on the part of the plaintiff in taking out his patent- and that such negligence or unreasonable delay amounts in Im to an abandonment  the case is disposed of. We contend also that the delay was not accounted for  the alleged reason for it being virtually contradicted by the testimony offered to make out his case.  and further, that the finding of the jury is conclusive-as to this point. The intent of the delay Of the patent, and whether the allowing the invention to be used without a patent, should not be considered, an abandonment, or a present of it to the public, arc questions for the jury: Morris v. Huntington, Paine s Rep. 22. The principles which we contend for, being recognized in many, of the cases cited on the part of the plaintiff, (particularly the case of Pennock v. Dialogue), it has been deemed unnecessary to' refer to those cases more particularly: If the charge of the judge was not erroneous as to the law, there can be no ground for. granting -a' new trial.\n",

      "judges:   parties:  Eleazer Carver, Plaintiff in error, v. Joseph A. Hyde and others, Defendants in error. opinions:  Mr. Chief Justice Taney delivered the opinion of the Court. This case is brought here by writ of error, directed to the Circuit Court of the United States for the district of Massachusetts. It is an action by the plaintiff in error against the defendants, to recover damages for the infringement of a patent right, obtained by the plaintiff on the 16th of November, 1839. The patent'is in the usual form, and tjhe questions before ,  us depend upon the construction of the specification, which is -in' the following words, v   Be it known, that I, Eleazer Carver, of Bridgewater, in the county of Plymouth, and state of Massachusetts, have invented a certain improvement in the manner of forming the ribs of saw-gins, for the ginning of cottonand I do hereby' declare that the following is a full and exact description thereof.   In the cotton-gin, as heretofore known and used, the fibres of the cotton are drawn by the teeth of circular saws, through a grating formed of a number of parall l bars, or ribs, having spaces between them sufficient to allow the saws to pass, carrying the fibres of the cotton with them, (which are then brushed off by a revolving brush,) but not wide enough to let the seeds, and other foreign substancfes, pass through. Above the saws the ribs come in close contract, thus forming a shoulder at the top of the space between- them. Various forms have been given to the 'bars or ribs,- with a view to procure a free passage of the cotton  but the cotton-gin, as heretofore made, has been always subject to the inconvenience of. the grate becoming choked by hard masses of cotton and motes, or false seeds, collecting in the upper part of the spaces b tw en the ribs, and impeding the action of the saws, and also preventing the mass of cotton which is drawn by, the saws up to the top of the spaces, but not drawn through them, from rolling back freely, so as to pass again over the saws, as it should do.   My improvement, which I am about to describe, is intended to obviate these difficulties  and it consists in giving a new'form to' the ribs composing the grate. Instead'of-making the ribs -of a bar of iron of equal thickness throughout, so that the upper and under surfaces shall be parallel, I so form the rib, that at the part where the saws pass through, carrying the cotton with them, the space, or depth between the upper and outer surface, and the lower, or inner surface, shall be greater than the thickness of the rib in other parts has heretofore been, or needs to be, and so great ais to be equal to the length of the fibre of the cotton to be ginned,'so that the fibre shall be kept extended between the ribs for about its full length, while it, is drawn through them by the saws. This mill, of course, requires, either that the rib should be as thick at that part as the length of the fibre, or that the rib should be forked, or divided, about that part, so. that the upper, or outer surface, and the under, or inner surface, shall diverge to that distance of .each other, instead of being parallel as formerly, when the rib was made of one bar of uniform thickness. This under, or inner surface, then takes a new direction upwards, and slopes towards the upper, or outer surface, until the two surfaces meet above the periphery of the saw  This last described part of the under surface is fastened against the framework of the gin. The operation of this improvement is, that those fibres of the cotton which are so firmly caught by the teeth of the saws as to be disengaged from the mass of the cotton to be ginned, are drawn out to their full length, and pass clear through the grate, and are then brushed off by the revolving brush, while the fibres that are drawn into the grate, but not caught by the teeth of the saws firmly enough to be carried quite through, are disengaged,- and pass up to where the under surface meets the upper surface,above the saws, and finding no obstruction there, pass back out. of the grate without cheking it, and roll down again with the mass of unginned cotton, and are caught below by the saws, and carried up again, and so on until all the fibres are drawn through.  The specification then proceeds to describe the invention more particularly, by referring to and explaining the drawings annexed to it, showing the advantages of his'improvement, the manner of arranging the ribs in the gin, and the mode of inserting and fastening them in the framework.- This description could not be comprehended without an exact drawing  nor is it necessary, 'in order to understand the questions of law in dispute between the parties. It is therefore omitted. After giving this description, the specification states the improvement, of which the patentee claims to be the inventor, as follows.   Having thus described my improved rib and its advantages, I now claim, as my invention, and desire to secure,' by letters patent, the increasing the depth, or space, between the upper, or outer surface of the rib, and the lower, or inner surface of it, at the part where the cotton is drawn through the grate, so that it shall be equal to the length of the fibre of the cotton to be ginned, (whether this be done by making the ribs thicker at that part, or by. a fork, or division of the rib, or by any other variation' of the particular form ) and I also claim,' as part of the said improvement, the sloping up of the lower, or inner surface of the rib, so as to meet the upper, or outer surface above the saws, leaving, When the rib is inserted into the frame, no break or shoulder between the two surfaces, but a smooth and Uninterrupted passage upwards between the ribs, as'above described.  At the trial in the Circuit Court, the plaintiff in error, after .having produced his patent with the schedule annexed to it, offered ip evidence, by the testimony of witnesses skilled in the art, that the rib described in the plaintiff s specification was a new and useful improvement  that the fastening of the rib to the framework in the manner therein stated had nothing to do with the ginning, but was only necessary to keep the rib firm  that the rib of the defendants was substantially in principle like that of the plaintiff, and operated in the same manner, and produced the same effect  and that, in their opinion, it- differed from the plaintiff s rib only by taking away a part which was wholly immaterial in the operation of ginning. The defendants then produced'witnesses skilled in the art, who testified that the ribs of the defendants did not substantially operate in the same manner with the plaintiff s, but were different in form and principle, and proceeded to state the particulars in which they differed  and testified that the defendants  ribs were entirely detached from the breast band,-and stood out in front of it, like the bar of the   Edenton grate,  which was known and in use long before the plaintiff s  and that the front and back surfaces of the defendants  ribs did not slope and meet at the upper end above the saws as the plaintiff described his to do, and was not shaped as the plaintiff s was exhibited and described in his drawings, specification, and claim.   Whereupon the defendants  counsel insisted that the ribs of the defendant,were, according tq the whole evidence, substantially different from those described and claimed -by the plaintiff, not only because, as the counsel alleged, it appeared by the whole of said evidence, that in the defendants  said ribs, no part of the under surface sloped upwards, and met the upper' surface above the periphery of the saw, and was there fastened against the framework of the gin  but, also, in the other particulars above described.   But the plaintiff s counsel insisted that said ribs were substantially alike, in all respects  and that in the rib of the defendants  the 'under surface did, according to said evidence, in fact, slope upwards, and meet the upper surface above the periphery of the saw, but that it was not necessary to the plaintiff s invention, as described and claimed in his said specification  nor was it essential to the said invention, in fact, that the under surface of the rib should be fastened against the framework of the gin, where the two surfaces meet, above the periphery of the saw. '  And the presiding judge who sat at the trial, aforesaid, did th h and there declare and deliver his opinion to the jury aforesaid, as follows, ,viz., That to entitle the plaintiff to maintain the action and'issue aforesaid, on his part, it was necessary, for the jury to be satisfied that the defendants had substantially violated and infringed the patent right of the plaintiff, ,as set forth and described in his patent. ' That if the defendants Used only such part of the said patented improvement as was known and used before his supposed invention, it was no violation or infringement thereof  that the improvement of the plaintiff, as specified and summed by him, was in the following .terms, viz.:  I now cl im as my invention, and desire to secure, by letters patent, the increasing the depth or space between the upper or outer surface of the rib, and the lower or inner surface of it, at the part where the cotton is drawn through the grate, so that it shall be equal to the length of the.fibre of the cotton to be ginned,, (whether this be done by making the ribs thicker at that part, or by a fork or division of the rib, or by any other varia-. cion of the particular form ) and I also claim as part of the. same improvement, the sloping up of the lower or inner surface of the rib, so as to meet the upper or outer surface above the saws, leaving, when the rib is inserted into the- frame, no break or shoulder between the two surfaces, but a smooth and uninterrupted passage upwards between the ribs, as above described.  That the true construction and interpretation of the specification and summing is, that it claims and states, as a substantial part of the -improvement, not only the increasing the depth or space 'between the upper or outer surface of the rib, and the lower or inner surface thereof, at the part where the cotton is drawn through the grate, so that it shall be equal to the length of the fibre of the, cotton to be ginned- in th  manner above stated, but it also claims and states as a substantial part of the same improvement, the sloping up of the lower and-inner surface-of the rib, so as to meet the upper or outer surface above the saws, leaving when the rib is inserted in the framework, no break or shoulder between the two surfaces, but a smooth and uninterrupted passage upwards between the. ribs, as described in the same specification  and that thereby the fixing or fastening of the ribs against the framework in the manner stated in the specification,, is made, by the- patentee a substantial. part of the said improvement  so that if the defendants do not fix or fasten the ribs.of their machine against the framework in the manner stated in the specification, either at all or substantially in the same manner as. the patentee, or fix or fasten it only in a manner known and., used before the plaintiff  s supposed invention, the defend is are not guilty of any violation or infringement of the plaintiff s patent, as stated in the declaration  and with this declaration, the said presiding judge left the said cause to the jury, who thereupon then and there returned a verdict for-the' defendants. It will be seen by this statement that the question, of law pre-, sented by- the exception is a very narrow one, and depends altogether on the construction of the specification. And it is difficult to make it understood, without the aid of the drawing or model. , The plaintiff considers the invention secured by the patent to consist of the rib only   and of that part of .the rib which by its form increases the depth between its upper or outer surface, and the lower or inner one, at the place where the cotton is drawn through the grate. He insists that the sloping up of the rib, so as to meet the upper or outer surface of the saw as well as the manner of fastening it against the. framework of the gin, as mentioned.in his .specification, are not substantial or essential parts of his invention. The question is, whether the , are claimed as such by his patent. The Circuit Court held hat they were, so claimed  and we think the opinion, was clearly right. They are expressly-stated by the patentee to be a part of the improverrent for which he asks a patent, and he describes particularly the smooth and uninterrupted passage up ward between the ribs, leaving no break or shoulder between the two surfaces, when the ribs were inserted in the framej as one of the advantages resulting from his improvement. And this smooth and. uninterrupted surface must necessarily depend not merely on the form of the rib, but also in the manher in which it is. connected with the framework. The rib in question is not an invention to be used by itself, but an improvement upon that portion, of the cotton gin  and is to be used in connection with other parts of a machine which has been publicly known and used a long time. There must, therefore, be some mode of fastening and connecting it with the other machinery  and the effect produced by the rib necessarily depends in a great degree upon the mode in which it is arranged and connected with the saw, and the other parts of the machine. He specifies the mode and claims it as part of his invention. According to his statement his improvement consisted in the form of the rib which increased the depth between the upper and lower surface, at the part where the cotton is drawn through the grate, in the sloping up so as .to meet the upper or outer surface .above the saws, and in the smooth and uninterrupted passage produced by the manner in which it was connected with -the frame. These three things he represents as constituting his improvement, and they are all combined together in his specification and claim, making together one invention to be used in connection with the other and old machinery of the cotton gin. And the drawing which accompanies his patent shows the manner in which the rib is sloped and arranged with the saw and annexed to the framework, in order to attain the object of the invention.   Now the end to be accomplished' is not the subject of a patent. The invention consists in the new and useful means of obtaining it. And if the defendant had by a rib of a substantially different form, or differently arranged with the saw, or not fastened at all to the frame, made an improvement which more effectually secured the object intended to be accomplished by the plaintiff s patent, it would be difficult to maintain that it could not be lawfully used, because it produced the same result with the plaintiff s invention. The usefulness of the rib depends altogether, as described in the specification, upon the manner of its connection with the periphery of the saw, and with the framework. And if, therefore, as was said by the Circuit Court, the rib made by the defendant was not fastened at all to the framework, or in a manner substantially different from the plaintiff s, or in a manner  nown and used before the plaintiff s invention, it was no infringement- of his patent. And whether the manner was the same in substance or not, was a question, of fact for the jury, and as they found for the defendant, we must assume that it was substantially different.   The judgment of the Circuit Court is therefore affirmed. attorneys:  The case was submitted to the Court, on printed arguments, by  Dexter, for. the plaintiff in error  and by Messrs.

      "judges:   parties:  LIVINGSTON et al. v. VAN INGEN et al. opinions:  LIVINGSTON, Circuit Justice. The complainants by their bill appear to be proprietors of boats on the Hudson river, propelled by steam, and claim a right to the exclusive navigation of the waters of New York in that way, in virtue of two patents from the United States, and several laws passed by this state. The defendants have built and are using a steam boat on the same river for carrying passengers, and are building another for the same purpose, in violation, as it is alleged, of their rights under these patents and laws. The bill prays that the complainants may be quieted in the possession and enjoyment of these rights  that the defendants may be restrained by injunction from constructing or using these boats on the waters of the state of New York  and that the rights of the complainants under their patents and the laws of the state may be established. All the parties are citizens   of the state of New York, and no action has been brought at law to try the title of the complainants. On the filing of this bill a motion has been made to a judge at his chambers for an injunction to restrain the defendants from the employment of their boat. The argument has been conducted with all the ability which might naturally be expected from the gentlemen concerned, and the importance and novelty of the case. The application is resisted on two grounds. The defendants contend: 1. That a circuit court of the United States, as a court of equity, between citizens of the same state, has no jurisdiction of this cause. 2. That if it had, this is not a case proper for its interposition in this way. It will not be denied that the awarding of a writ of injunction of this nature is one of the highest and most important functions which a court of equity can be called upon to exercise. The court is asked to inhibit a party from the full use and enjoyment of his property without any previous trial whatever   when that property is of a perishable nature, and must have been built at a very great expense, and -when, if employed, it cannot fail of producing great gains, for the loss of which, however serious or extensive, the owners, if eventually successful in the controversy, will have no remedy against any one  while the plaintiffs, if aggrieved, will be entitled to a threefold recompense for any subtraction or diminution of profits to which they may for some time be exposed. This too, it is expected, will be done without the previous institution of any action at law, and without the opportunity of any other proper mode of trial to decide on the matters which the defendants are authorized by law to allege in their defence. When process of such high import and serious consequences is applied for, it becomes a court, and still more a judge at his chambers, to inquire with more than ordinary circumspection into his powers, and to stay his hand, unless he shall be fully and entirely satisfied of his jurisdiction  that the merits of the complainants are very great, and that they are eminently entitled to the favour of the public, and to every reasonable protection which government can afford, no one will deny. But when we are inquiring not into what ought, but into what has been done, considerations of this kind, however naturally or excusably they may be pressed upon a court, can afford but little aid in coming to a correct decision. A judge of the supreme court may in vacation allow a writ of injunction in those cases only, where it may be granted by the supreme or a circuit court. That the supreme court, unless on appeal, has the power of awarding this writ is not pretended. The examination therefore has been properly confined to the authority of a circuit court. If the circuit court of this district possesses no jurisdiction over the cause, it follows that the present application must fail. This jurisdiction is denied on the ground, that the parties, being all citizens of the same state, have no right to apply to the equity side of the court for relief by original bill, unless jurisdiction in such case be given by some act of congress. By the federal constitution, the judicial power is vested in one supreme court, and in such inferior courts as congress may from time to time ordain and establish, and extends to all cases in law and equity, arising under the constitution and laws of the United States, and controversies between citizens of different states. A further enumeration of its powers is not *ov understanding the present question. By the judiciary act [1 Stat. 73], the circuit courts ltave original cognizance, concurrent with state courts, of all suits of a civil nature at common law or in equity, of a certain value, where the United States are plaintiffs, or an alien is a party  or where the suit is between a citizen of the state where it is brought, and a citizen of another state. By an act passed in 1800 [2 Stat. 37], an action on the case, founded on that, and a former act, is given to a patentee whose rights are invaded. to be prosecuted in the circuit court of the United States, having jurisdiction thereof, for a sum equal to three times the actual damage sustained. But this being a suit in equity, it is asked by what authority it is brought here, unless the parties be citizens of different states: and much has been said of the impropriety of an inferior tribunal extending its jurisdiction to cases not particularly assigned to it. If these courts be not inferior in the technical sense of the books, which they most certainly are not. they are so in some respects. They are not only so considered by the constitution, but are in fact subordinate to the supreme court, and notwithstanding their high and responsible original powers, which extend to so many and such important cases, of a criminal and civil nature, and by appeal, to admiralty and maritime causes, there can be no doubt that their jurisdiction is special and limited, both in regard to the nature of the cases on which they can decide, and the character of the parties who can come into them. It is as certain, that they are indebted to congress, under the constitution, for their creation, and that instead of extending their powers as the exigencies of suitors may require, or may by themselves be thought reasonable, they have hitherto been regarded as dependent on that body for all the powers they possess. Owing as they do their existence to congress, from them must necessarily flow that portion of the general judicial power which, by the constitution, they have a right to divide among the inferior courts that may be established. Thus constituted and organized, little would it become them to transcend a jurisdiction, which the constitution intended should be-limited at the discretion of the legislature, and which congress have circumscribed accordingly. While moving within their legitimate sphere, as marked out by the legislature, they may .hope to give satisfaction, and to inspire confidence in the important department of government of which they form a branch. It would seem then enough to say that there being no act of congress conferring on these courts a right in any case to take cognizance of a suit in equity, between citizens of the same state, this court can have no jurisdiction of the present cause, which is between parties of that character. This seemed to be almost conceded, unless by the constitution there was secured to these courts certain powers which might be called into exercise without waiting for any special authority from congress. To show that this was the case, it was said, that this being a case arising under the laws of the United States, and being found in the constitutional enumeration of cases of federal cognizance, it must, whether allotted by congress to a particular tribunal or not, be cognizable by one or other of the courts which may be established. This argument proceeds on a  supposition that the whole power of the judiciary must always reside somewhere, so as to be called into operation as occasions may require. If congress had created inferior courts without any designation as to the cases of which they were to take cognizance, it is said they would have concurrent jurisdiction of all cases mentioned in the constitution, except of those which were therein exclusively devolved on the supreme court. That this being a case of chancery cognizance, and the district court, not possessing equity power, must, ex necessitate, be triable where such powers exist, or that there will be a failure of justice  and the danger of permitting congress in any way to abridge the objects of' cognizance secured by tbe constitution to the judiciary, and, through them, to the people of the United States, was expatiated on at some length. As congress cannot add to those powers, it should not be admitted for a moment, it was argued, that they possessed the right of substracting from them, or of permitting them to be dormant, by not legislating sufficiently. Without stopping to inquire whether there be any ground for these apprehensions, or denying any weight to the argument, it will not be deemed disrespectful to the counsel who advanced it, if it is not thought necessary to examine the course of reasoning, from which this conclusion is presumed to follow, because on this point we are not without authority. The supreme court has decided, and after an argument, which, if we except the one to which X have just had the pleasure and honour of attending, has perhaps never been surpassed on any occasion  that if jurisdiction of cases arising under the laws of the United States be not conferred on the circuit courts by an act of congress, they cannot take cognizance of them. The case of the Bank of the United States against Deveaux, is here referred to, which was decided in February term, 1809, a report of which is not yet published. It was there made one question, whether a right was conferred on the bank to sue in these courts by its act of incorporation, or any other law of congress. It was decided not only that the circuit court derived no jurisdiction over a case arising under the laws of the United States from the judiciary act, that class of cases not being provided for by it, but that from the law which incorporates it, the bank acquired no right to bring an action in those courts, although there were expressions in that act, which it was very strongly insisted on, gave it to them. In support of this decision, if it required any to render it binding, reference might be made to a contemporaneous exposition of the constitution by the great and wise men who composed the legislature that organized the judiciary, and to what appears to have been the understanding of congress from that time to the present day  for whenever it was intended that these courts should take cognizance of a case arising under any law of the United States, such power was expressly delegated to one of the federal courts, congress well knowing that the judiciary act was silent on this point, and not supposing that any such power by the constitution was given to the circuit court This too may be collected from an act that passed in 1800, which, in terms, gave to the courts then erected, jurisdiction over, this class of cases, but which act, being afterwards repealed, although not on account of this clause, left us as before, without any general provision on the subject. If other evidences are wanting that the supreme court has not fallen into so great an error, as it was thought to have done by this decision, it might be'collected from the journal of the senate of the United States. There we find that the judiciary act was prepared by a committee consisting of a member from each state, most if not all professional men, and it cannot be believed that, in a law drawn with so much care, and embracing such a variety of provisions, so important an omission was casual. It must have been the result of much reflection, and shows their sense at least, that congress were not bound to clothe the courts which they might create with all the powers which by the constitution they had a right to confer. When it is recollected that three gentlemen of this committee were afterwards judges of the courts of the United States, an allusion to what must have been their opinion when senators,- on a point immediately under their consideration, cannot be thought improper. The same principle is recognised by the very laws under which the plaintiffs claim  for the judiciary act not having made any such provision in such a case,- unless the parties were citizens of different states, it was thought necessary to establish by those acts the right of a patentee to sue in a circuit court, but at the same time, such right was restricted to its legal forum: as it regards this case then, the legislature is not chargeable with any omission, or with affording a remedy, without a designation of the tribunal which was to administer it, for although by the constitution the judicial power is extended to all cases in law and equity, arising under the laws of the Union, congress may certainly say that the relief which they intended to afford in a particular case shall be at law only. If it had been thought proper to proceed at law in this court, the complainants would probably have found no difficulty on the score of jurisdiction, and it may be added, that if this case be of equity cognizance at all, (which has been strongly controverted and on which no opinion is given,) it is probably so at common law, and in that case congress were not bound, even if they had the right, to give jurisdiction of it to any federal court. It was further urged in favour of the present jurisdiction, that the supreme court of this state has decided that an action cannot be maintained there, founded on the patent laws of the United States  and that as the court of chancery of the state would give no relief, the parties thus excluded from the federal and state courts, would be without redress, if the decision of the supreme court of the United States were considered as applying to them. It is not for me to say what the chancellor of this state will think his duty, if a similar application be made to him  but if this be a case of equitable jurisdiction at common law, as it was sometimes alleged to be by the complainant s counsel, no objection is perceived to his taking cognizance of it. But should he think otherwise, there is still another answer to this difficulty, which is that if the parties be remediless it is no fault of the law, which gives them if not a perfect, at least a liberal, and what will probably prove, if they choose to pursue it, a very effectual remedy  tor it is not to be believed, as was supposed at the bar, that they will have to bring action after action to establish their right. Let them proceed in only one trial at law, and the defendants will not be hardy or foolish enough to continue on very unequal terms, what will then be settled to be a violation of their patent rights  such a verdict will for ever after keep all intruders at a distance. But if absolutely without remedy elsewhere, it does not follow that this court can help them. A court, constituted like this, is not to reason itself into jurisdiction from considerations of hardship, when a plain and safe rule is prescribed by the supreme court, which is, to examine on all occasions, what powers are committed to it, by the laws of the United States. NOTE. The chancellor of the state was aft-erwards applied to for an injunction in this case, and refused it  but on an appeal from his decision to the court of errors, it was granted. 9 Johns. 507. Congress have since supplied this defect of jurisdiction. By the act of 15th of February, 1819, it is provided,  that the circuit courts of the United States shall have original cognizance, as well in equity as at law, of all actions, suits, controversies, and cases, arising under any law of the United States, granting or confirming to authors or inventors the exclusive right to their respective writings, inventions, and discoveries: and upon any bill in equity, filed by any party aggrieved in any such cases, shall have authority to grant injunctions, according to the course and principies of courts of equity, to prevent the violation of the rights of any authors or inventors, secured to them by any laws of the United States, on such terms and conditions as the said courts may deem fit and reasonable: provided however, that from all judgments and decrees of any circuit courts, rendered in the premises, a writ of error or appeal, as the case may require, shall lie to the supreme court of the United States, in the same manner, and under the same circumstances, as is now provided by law in other judgments and decrees of such circuit courts.  6 Colvin s Laws 369 [3 Stat. 481). Another argument which it may be expected will be noticed, was, that as an action at law under the patent acts may be prosecuted in this court, even between citizens of the same state, there was, necessarily, conferred on it a right to hold jurisdiction of the present bill  for as the court possessed equity powers in virtue of the judiciary act, it was impossible to give it jurisdiction as a court of law, without at the same time calling into exercise its powers as a court of equity. If it becomes necessary in an action at law regularly before it, for either party to appeal to its equity side, in aid or defence of such action, such application might not be improper. But this.is not a bill of that kind. It would be the action at law in such case, on which its jurisdiction would attach. But the answer to the argument is, that by the judiciary act no equity powers are given to this court, between citizens of the same state  and it results from the decision which has been cited, that a circuit court must not only confine itself to the cases defined by congress, but that if by a particular act it is authorized to proceed in the given case as a court of law only, a party must come into it on that side, to bring himself within the provisions of it. There being then no law conferring on this court a right to take cognizance as a court of equity of eases of this nature, between citizens of the same state, my opinion is, that this court cannot entertain cognizance of the present bill, and that the plaintiffs therefore can take nothing by their motion. After this decision, it would be superfluous and improper to express any opinion on any other of the important points which were made on the argument of the present question. If the parties were citizens of different states, it is not intended to say that the plaintiffs would or would not be entitled to the equitable relief which they seek. The defendant s counsel tendered a bill of  exceptions to the admission of Anderson s testimony. and also to the opinion of the court on the points stated in the charge.

      "judges:   parties:  Joseph Grant and others v. E. and H. Raymond. opinions:  Mr Chief Justice Marshall delivered the opinion of the' Court. This action wa  brought by Grant and Townsend against E. and H. Raymond, to recover damages for an infringement of their right under a patent gfanted to- the plaintiff Joseph Grant, in April 1825. It recited that a former patent had been issued in August 1821, to the same person for the same improvement,   which had'been cancelled, owing to the defective specification on which the same was granted.  The exclusive privilege given by the patent on which the suit is brought, is to continue fourteen years from the day on which the original was issued. One of the pleas filed by the defendants, contained.the following averment:   and the defendants aver that said specification does not correctly or accurately describe the improvement claimed by the said Joseph Grant as his invention, but said specification, and the drawings thereto annexed,  re altogether defective in this, among other things, namely: in said specification no proportion, sizes or distances are given, and the bigness or size of none of the principal parts of said machine is given in said specifications or drawings, but the same is wholly omitted  and in other particulars,, said specifications and drawings are wholly defective: and the defendants aver that said specification annexed to and making part of said letter's patent, with the drawings thereto annexed, do not contain a written description of his the said Joseph Grant s invention and improvement aforesaid, and manner of using it, in such full, clear and exact terms, as to distinguish the same from all other things -before known, and so as to enable   any person skilled in the art of which said machine or improvement is a branch, or with which it is most nearly connected, to make and use the same   nd that for the cause aforesaid, said letters patent are-void.  The plaintiffs reply that they ought not to be barred,   because they say that the specification mentioned in the said last mentioned plea, does correctly and accurately describe the improvement claimed by the said Joseph Grant as his invent tion  and because they say further, that neither the said specification, nor the drawings thereto annexed, are defective in any of the particulars in that behalf alleged in the said last mentioned pl.ea, and this they pray may be inquired of by the country.  On this replication issue was joined. At the trial the counsel for the defendants objected that the secretary of state had no power by law to accept a surrender of, and to cancel the said letters patent, or to inquire into or to decide upon the causes for so doing, or to grant said second patent for the same invention with an amended specification, for the unexpired portion of the term of fourteen years which had been granted by the first patent. The court decided that such surrender might be.made when the defect arose from inadvertence or mistake  and without any fraud or misconduct on the part of the patentee  and that the secretary of state had authority to accept such surrender, and cancel the record of the patent, and to issue a new patent for the unexpired part of the fourteen years granted under .the old patent, in manner aforesaid. To which decision the counsel for the defendants excepted. After adducing the testimony on which they relied to support their plea herein before stated, the counsel for the defendants moved the court to instruct the jury that if they found that the defendants had maintained and proved their averments in that respect, that they must find the same for the defendants  which instructions the court refused to. give, but instructed the jury that the patent would not be void on this ground, unless such defective or imperfect specification or description arose from design, and for the purpose of deceiving the public  to which opinion the counsel for the defendants also excepted. The jury found a verdict for the plaintiffs, and assessed their damages to three thousand two hundred and sixty-six .dollars sixty-six cents: the judgment on'which is brought .before this court by a writ of error. The first question in the cause respects the power of the secretary of state to receive a surrender of a patent, cancel the record thereof, and issue a new patent for the unexpired part of the fourteen years for which the original had been granted. The court was of opinion that this might be done   when the defect in the specification arose from inadvertence or mistake, and without any fraud or misconduct on the part of the patentee.  The right of the patentee to surrender his patent has not been denied, but the plaintiffs in error insist that no power exists to grant a new patent for the unexpired term. The words of the act, they say, do not confer this power. It cannot be exercised with its necessary guards by the department of State  andjncon venience of no inconsiderable magnitude might 'result to the public from its exercise. The secretary of state is, in the act of making out patents, a mere ministerial officer, and can exercise no power which is not expressly given. It is undoubtedly true, that the secretary of state may be considered, in issuing patents, as a ministerial officer. If the prerequisites of the law be complied with, he can exercise no-judgment on the question whether the patent shall be issued. It is equally true that the act of congress contains no words  which expressly authorise the secretary to' issue a corrected patent, if the original, from some mistake or inadvertence in the patentee, should be found incompetent to secure the reward which the law intended to confer on him for his invention. The force of this objection, and of the argument founded on it is felt. If the new patent can be sustained, it must be on the general spirit and object of the law, not on its letter. To promote the progress of useful arts, is the interest and policy of every enlightened government. It entered into- the views of the framers of our constitution, and the power   to promote the progress of science, and useful arts, by securing for limited times to authors and inventors, the exclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries,  is among those expressly given to congress. J-This subject was among the first which followed the organization of our government. It was taken up by, the first congress at its second session, and an act was passed authorising a patent to be issued to the inventor of. any useful art,&c. on his petition,  granting to such petitioner, his heirs, administrators or assigns, for any term not exceeding fourteen years, the sole and exclusive right and liberty of making, using, and vending to others to be used, the said invention or discovery.  The law farther declares that the patent   shall be good and available to the grantee or grantees by force of this act, to all and every intent and purpose herein contained.  The emendatory act of 1793 contains the same language, and it eannot be doubted that the settled purpose of the United States has ever been, and continues to be, to confer on the authors of useful inventions an exclusive right in their inventions for the time mentioned in their patent. It is the reward stipulated for the advantages derived by the public for the exertions of the individual, and is intended as a-stimulus to those exertions. The laws which are passed to give effect .to this purpose ought, we think, to be construed in the spirit in which they have been made  and to execute the contract fairly on the part of the United States, where the full benefit has been actually received: if this can be done without transcending the intention of the statute, or countenancing acts which are fraudulent or may prove mischievous. The public yields nothing.which it has not agreed to yield  it receives all which it has contracted to receive. The full. benefit of the discovery, after its enjoyment by the discoverer for fourteen years, is preserved  and for his exclusive enjoyment of it during that time the public faith is pledged. That sense of justice and of right which all feel, pleads strongly against depriving the inventor of the compensation thus solemnly promised, b causc he. has committed an inadvertent or innocent mistake. . If the mistake should be committed in the department of state, no' one would say that it ought not to.b.e corrected. All would admit that a new patent, correcting the error, and which would secure to the patentee the benefits which the law intended to secure, ought to be issued. And yet the act does not in terms authorises new patent, even Jn this case. Its emanation is not founded on the words of the law, but is indispensably necessary to the faithful execution of the solemn promise made by the United States. Why should not the same step be taken for the same purpos , if the mistake has been innocently committed by the inventor himself? The counsel for the plaintiffs in error have-shovvn'very clearly that the question of inadvertence or mistake is a'judicial question, which cannot be decided by the secretary of state. Neither can he decide those judicial questions on which the validity of the first patent depends. Yet he issues it without inquiring into them. Why may he not, in like manner, issue the second patent also ? The correct performance of all those preliminaries on which the validity of the original depends, are always examinable in the court in which a suit  for its violation shall be brought. Why may not those points on which the validity of the amended patent depends  be examined b fore the same tribunal? In the ease under consideration those questions were not supposed by the circuit court to have been decided in the department of state, but were expressly submitted to the jury. The rightfulness of issuing the new patent is declared to depend on the fact, that   the defect in the specification arose from inadvertence or mistake, and without any fraud or misconduct on the part of the patentee.  The jury were of course to inquire into the fact. The condition on which the right to issue the patent depended, could be stated to them, for no other purpose. It has been said that this permission to issue a new patent on a reformed specification,   when the first was defective through the mistake of the patentee, would change the whole .character of the act of eongress. We are not convinced of this. The great object and intention of the act is to secure to the public the advantages to be derived from the discoveries of individuals, and the means it employs are the compensation made to those individuals for the time and labour devoted to these discoveries, by the exclusive right to tpake, use and sell, the things discovered for a limited time.   That which gives complete effect-to this object arid intention, by employing the same means for the correction of inadvertent error which are directed in the first instance, cannot, we think, be a departure from the spirit and character of the act. An objection much relied on is, that after the invention has been brought into general use, those skilled in the art or science with which it is connected, perceiving the variance between the specification and the machine, and av iling themselves of it, may have constructed, sold and used1 the machine without infringing the legal rights of the patentee, or incurring the penalties of the law. The new patent would retro-act on them, and expose them to penalties to which .they were not liable when the act was committed. - This objection is more.formidable in appearance than in reality. It is not probable that the defect in the specification can be so apparent as to be perceived by any but those who examine it for the purpose of pirating the invention. They are not entitled to much favour. But the answer to the objection is, that this defence is not made in this case  and the opinion of the circuit court does not go so far as to say that such a defence would not be successful. That question is not before the court,  and is not involved in the opinion we are considering: The defence when true in fact may be sufficient in law, notwithstanding the validity of the new patent. It has been also argued that the new patent must issue on the new specification, and on the application which accompanies it. Consequently, it will not be true that the machine was   not known or used before the' application.  Rut the new patent, and the proceedings on which it issues, have- relation to the original transaction. The time of the privilege still runs from the date, of the original patent. The application may be considered as appended to the original application] and, if the new patent is valid, the law must be considered as satisfied if the machine was .not known or used before that application. It has been urged that the public was put into possession of the machine by the open sale and use of it under the defective-specification, and'- cannot be deprived of it by the grant of a new patent. The machine is no longer the subject of a patent. This would be perfectly true, if the second patent could be considered as independent of the first. But it is in no respect so considered'. The communication of the discovery to the public has been made in pursuance of law, with the intent to exercise a privilege which is the consideration paid by the public for the future use of the machine. If, by an innocent mistake, the instrument-introduced to secure this privilege fails in its object, the public ought not to avail itself of this mistake, and to appropriate the discovery without paying the stipulated consideration. The attempt would be disreputable in an individual, and a court of equity might interpose to restrain him. It will not be pretended that this question is free from difficulty. But the executive departments, it is understood, have acted on the construction adopted by the circuit court, and have considered it as settled. We would not willingly disregard this settled practice in a case where we are not satisfied it is contrary to law, and where we are satisfied that it is required by justice and good faith. We will now proceed to the second exception. The plea-assigns the particular defect supposed to exist in the specification, and then proceeds to avei , in the very words of the act, that it  does not contain a written description of his the saiij Joseph Grant s invention and improvement aforesaid, and manner of using it, in such full, clear, and exact terms as to distinguish the same from all other things before known, and so as to enable any person skilled in the art, &c. to make and use the same,  &c. The plea- alleges, in the words of the act, that the pre-requisites to the issuing a patent had not been complied with. If the matter alleged in this plea constituted no bar to the action, the plaintiffs might have demanded, and have submitted the question of law to the court. But they have chosen to deny the facts alleged in the plea, and to aver in their replication  that neither the specification nor the drawings thereto annexed, are defective in any of the particulars in that behalf alleged.  Issue was joined upon this replication, and it is that issue which the jury were sworn to try. At the trial the counsel for the defendants, after the evidence was closed, asked the court, in substance, to instruct the jury that if,they should be of opinion that the defendants had maintained and proved the facts alleged- in their plea, they must find for the defendants. The court refused this instruction. Ought it to have been refused? If in the opinion of the jury the defendants have proved and maintained every fact alleged in the plea on which the issue they are sworn to try is joined, ought not the jury to find that issue for the defendants? Is not this required by their oaths? The conclusion,  and that for the cause aforesaid, said lettex-s patent are void,  is an inference of law from the facts previously alleged  not the allegation of a distinct fact to be submitted to the jury. The court proceeded to instruct the jury   that the- patent would not be void on this ground, unless such defective or. imperfect specification  r description arose from design or for the purpose, of deceiving the public.   Now this   design,  this   purpose of deceiving the public,  constituted no part of the issue. The defendants had not alleged it, and could not be supposed to come prepared to prove it. A verdict for them would not imply it. -The instruction is understood to direct a verdict which finds in fact that thedescription or specification is not defective  and this verdict against the evidence is to be found because that defect   arose not from design, or for the purpose of deceiving the public.    But we must inquire whether the instruction, independent of its departure from the issue, be consistent with law. It is  that the patent would not be void unless,  &e. The.fifth section of the act gives the party aggrieved an action for the infringement of his patent right. The sixth provides   that the defendant in such action shall be permitted to plead the general issue, and give this act in evidence, and to give in.evidence any special matter, of which notice in writing may have been given to the plaintiff or his attorney thirty days before trial, tending to prove that the specification filed by the plaintiff does not contain the vyhole truth relative to his discovery, or that it contains more than is necessary to produce the described effict  which concealment or addition shall fully appear to have been made for the purpose of deceiving the public  or that the thing thus secured,  &c.   in either of which cases judgment shall be rendered for the defendant with costs, and the patent shall be declared void.   Courts did not, perhaps, at first distinguish clearly between a defence which would authorise a verdict- and judgment in favour of the defendant  n the particular action, leaving the plaintiff free to use his patent, and to bring other suits for its infringement  and one Which, if successful, would re,quire the court to enter a judgment not only for the defendant in the particular case, but one which declares the patent to be void. This distinction is now'well settled. If the party is content with defending himself, he may either plead specially  or plead the general issue, and give the notice required by the sixth section of any special matter he means to use at the trial. If he shows that the pat ntee has failed in any of those pre-requisites on which the authority to issue the patent is made to depend, his defence is complete. He is entitled to the verdict of the jury and the judgment of the court. But if, not content with defending himSelf, he seeks to annul the patent, he must proceed in. precise conformity to- the sixth section. If he depends on evidence  tending to prove |hat the specification filed by the plaintiff does not contain the whole truth relative to his discovery, or that it contains more than is necessary to produce the described effect,  it may avail him so far as respects himself, but will hot justify a judgment declaring the patent Void, unless such   concealment or addition shall fully appear to have been made for the purpose of deceiving the public   .which purpose must be found by the jury to justify'a'judgment-of vacatur by the court. The defendant is permitted to proceed according to the sixth section, but is not prohibited from proceeding in the usual manner, so far as respects his defence  except that special matter may not be given in evidence on the general issue unaccompanied by the notice which the sixth section- requires. The sixth section is not understood to control the third. ' The evidence of fraudulent intent is required only in the particular case, .and for the particular purpose stated in the sixth section. This instruction was material if the verdict ought to have been for the defendants, provided the allegations of the plea were sustained, and if such verdict would have supported a judgment in their favour .although the defect in the specification might not have arisen from design, and for the purpose of deceiving the public. That such is the law we are entirely satisfied. The third section requires, as preliminary, to .a patent, a correct specification and description of the thing discovered. This is necessary in order to give the public, after the privilege shall expire, the advantage for which the privilege is allowed, and is the foundation of the power to issue the patent. The necessary consequence of the ministerial character in which the secretary acts, is that the performance-of the pr -requisites to a patent must be examinable in any suit brought upon it. If the case was of the first impression, we should come to this conclusion  but it is understood to be settled. The act of p rliament concerning monopolies contains an exception on which the grants of patents for inventions have issued in that country. The construction of so much of that exception as connects the specification with the patent, and makes the validity, of the latter dependent on the correctness of the former, is applicable, we think, to proceedings under the third- section of the American act. The English books are full of cases in which it has been held that a defective specification is a good bar when pleaded to, or a sufficient defence when given in evidence on the general issue, on an action brought for the infringement of a patent right. They are very well summed up in Godson s Law of Patents, title Specification: and also in the chapter respecting the infringement of patents: also in Holroyd on Patents, where he treats of the specification, its form and requisites. It is deemed unnecessary to go through the cases, because there is no contrariety in them, and because the question is supposed to be substantially settled in this country. Pennock and Sellers v. Dialogue, 1 Peters, 1, was not, it is true, a case of defect in the specification or description required by the third section, but one in which the applicant did not bring himself within the provision of the first section, which requires that before a patent shall issue the petitioner shall allege that he has invented a new and useful art, machine, &c.   not known or used before the application.  This pre-requisite of the first section, so far as a failure in it may affect the validity of the patent, is not distinguishable from a failure of the pre-requisites of the third section. On the trial evidence was given to show , that the patentee had permitted his invention to be used before he took out his patent. The court declared its opinion to the jury, that if an inventor makes his discovery public, he abandons the inchoate right to the exclusive use of the invention.   It is possible,  added the court,  that the inventor may not have intended to give the benefit of his discovery to the public.   But it is not a question of intention,    but of legal inference, resulting from the. conduct of the inventor, and affecting the interests of the public. It is for the jury to say whether the evidence brings this case within the principle which has been stated. If it does, the court is of opinion that the plaintiff is not entitled to a verdict.  The jury found a verdict for,-the defendants, an exception was taken to the opinion, and the judgment was affirmed by this court. This case affirms the principle that a failure on the part.of the patentee, in those pre-requisites of the act which authorise a patent, is a bar to a recovery in an action for its infringement  and that the validity of this defence does not depend on the invention of the inventor, but is a legal inference upon his conduct. Upon these authorities and this reasoning we are of opinion that the instruction was erroneous, and that the judgment ought to be reversed and the cause remanded. One of the judges composing the majority thinks, that the direction would have been erroneous on a plea properly framed upon the third section of the act, and averring the facts of a defective specification, and a non-compliance with other requisitions of that section, for that such a plea would be a good bar and defence to the action: but, in his view, the plea relies upon the facts as avoiding the patent entirely, and avers it to be void. He thinks, however, that the replication puts the facts, and not the. point whether void or not, in issue  and that the direction of the court was erroneous, since it was equivalent to a declaration, that if all the facts were proved, the issue ought not to be found for the defendants, unless the imperfection of th.e specification arose from a-fraudulent design. The judgment is reversed, and the cause-remanded with directions to issue a venire facias de novo. This cause came on to be heard on the transcript of the record from the circuit court of the United' States for the southern district of New York, and was argued by counsel. On consideration whereof, it is the opinion of this Court- that the said circuit court 'erred in instructing the jury   that the pat nt .would not be void on this grodnd, unless such defective or imperfect specification or description arose from design,- and for the purpose of deceiving the public.  Whereupon it is ordered and adjudged by this Court, that the judgment of the said circuit court in this cause be  and the same is hereby reversed, and .that this cause be, and the same is hereby remanded to the said circuit court, with directions to award a venire facias de novo. attorneys:  The case was argued by Mr Webster, for the defendants in the circuit court, now befor  the court as plaintiffs in   tsrror  and. by Mr Ogden, for the defendants, plaintiffs in the circuit court.    Mr Webster stated,    Mr Ogden, for the defendants in error. corrections:  head_matter: Joseph Grant and others v. E. and H. Raymond. Action for damages for an infringement of a patent rignt, granted to the plaintiff in 1825. The patent recited that a former patent had been issued in 1821, to the same person, for the same improvement,   which had been cancelled, owing to the defective specification on which the same was granted.  The exclusive privilege given by the patent on which the suit was brought, is to continue fourteen years from the day on which the original was issued. On the trial, the defendants objected that the secretary of state had no power, by law, to accept a surrender of, and to cancel the first letters patent  or to inquire into, and decide upon the causes for so doing  or to grant the second patent for the same invention with an amended specification, for the (mexpired portion of the term of fourteen years which had been granted by.the.first patent. The circuit court of the southern district of New York decided, in conformity with its former decisions, that such surrender might be made when the defect arose from inadvertence or mistake  and Without any fraud or misconduct on the part of the patentee: and that the secretary of slate had authority to aocept such surrender, arid cancel the record of the patent  and to issue a new patent for the unexpired part of the fourteen years granted under the first patent. By the court: It will not be pretended that this question is free from difficulty. But the executive departments, it is understood, have acted on the construction adopted by the circuit court,- and have Considered it as settled. We .would not willingly disregard the settled practice, in a case where we are not satisfied it is contrary to law  arid where we are satisfied it is tequired by justice and good faith. To promote the progress of useful arts, is the interest and policy of every enlightened government. It entered into the views of the framers of our constitution, and the power  to promote the progress of science and useful arts by securing, for limited times, to authors and inventors, the exclusive right to tfieir respective writings and discoveries,  is among those expressly given to congress. It is. the.re ward stipulated for advantages derived by the public for the exertions of individuals  and is intended as a stimulus to those exertions. The laws which are passed to give effect to this purpose ought to be construed in the Spirit in which they have been made, and to execute the contract fairly on the part of the United States, where the full benefit, has been received  if this can bedorie without'transcending the intentions of the statutes, or countenancing acts which are fraudulent, or may prove mischievohs. If a mistake should be committed in the department of state, no one would say it ought not be corrected.. All would admit, that a new patent, correcting the error, and which would secure to the patentee the benefits which the law intended to secure, ought to be issued  and yet the law does not, in terms, authorise a new patent, even in such a case.. Its emanation is not founded on the words of the law, but it is indispensably necessary to the faithful execution ofthe solemn promise made by the United States. Why should not the same step be' taken, for the same purpose, if the mistake has been innocently committed by the inventor himself? The great object and intention of the act is to secure to the public the advantages to be derived from the discoveries of individuals  and the means it employs are the compensation made to those individuals for the time and labour devoted'to those discoveries, by the exclusive right to make up and sell the things discovered for a limited time. That which gives complete effect to this object and intention,, by employing the same means for the correction of inadvertent error which are directed in the first instance, cannot be a departure from the spirit and character of the act. Qucsre, What would be the effect of a second patent, issued after an innocent mistake in the specification, on those who, skilled in the act for which it was granted, perceiving the variance between the specifications and the machine, had constructed, sold and used the machine. This question is not before the court, and is not involved in the opinion given in the case. The defence, when true in fact  may be sufficient in law, notwithstanding the validity of the new ' patent. The defendant in the circuit court, in his plea, assigned the particular defect supposed to exist in the specification, and then proceeded to answer in the very words of the act,   that it does not contain a written description of the plaintiff s invention and improvement, and manner of using it, in such full, clear, and exact terms, as to.distinguish the same' from all other things before known, so as to enable any person skilled in the art to make and use the same. The plea alleged in the words of the act, that the prerequisites to issuing a patent had not been complied with. The plaintiffs denied the facts alleged in the plea, and on this issue was joined. At the trial, the counsel for the defendants, after the evidence was closed, asked the court to instruct the jury, that if they should be of opinion that the defendants had maintained and proved the facts alleged in their plea, they must find for the defendants. The court refused this instruction, and instructed the jury that the patent would not be void on this ground, unless such defective or imperfect specification or description arose from design, or for the purpose of deceiving the public. By the court: The instruction was erroneous,, and the judgment of the circuit court ought'to be reversed. This instruction was material if the verdict ought to have been for the defendants  provided the allegations of the plea were sustained, and if such verdict would have supported a judgment in their favour  although the defect in the specification might not have arisen from design, and for the purpose of deceiving the public. That such is the law, the court' is entirely satisfied. The third section of the act requires, as preliminary to a patent, a correct specification and description of .the thing discovered. This is necessary in order to give the public, after the privilege shall expire, the advantage for which the privilege is allowed, and is the foundation of the power to issue a patent. The necessary consequences of the ministerial character in which the secretary acts, is, that the performance of the prerequisites to a patent must be examinable in any suit brought upon it. If the case was of the first impression, the court would cometo this conclusion  but -it is understood to be settled. Courts did not, perhaps, at first, distinguish clearly between a defence which would authorise a verdict and judgment in favour of a defendant in an action for the violation of a patent, leaving the plaintiff free to use his patent, and to bring other suits for its infringement  and ono which, if successful, would require the court to enter a judgment not only for the defendant in the particular case, but one which declares the patent to be void. This distinction is now well settled. If the party is content with defending himsolf, he may either plead specially, or plead the general issue and give the notice required by the sixth section, of any special matter he means to use at the trial. If he shows that the patentee has failed in any of those ,prerequisites on which the authority to issue the patent is made to depend, his defence is complete. He is entitled to the verdict of the jury, and the judgment of the court. But if, not content with defending himself, he seeks to annul the patent, he must proceed in precise conformity, with the sixth section. If he depends on evidence   tending to prove that the specification filed by the plaintiff does not contain the whole truth relative to his discovery, or that it contains more than is necessary to produce the desired effect   it may avail him so far as respects himself, but will not justify a judgment declaring the patent void  unless   such concealment or addition shall fully appear to have been made for the purpose of deceiving the public   which purpoB? iriust be found by the jury, to justify   judgment of vacatur. The defendant is permitted -to proceed according to the sixth section, but   is not prohibited from proceeding in the usual manner, so far as respects his defence  except that special matter may not be given in evidence on the general  issue, .unaccompanied by the notice which the sixth section requires. The sixth section is riot understood to control the third. The evidence of fraudulent intent is required only in the particular case, and for the particular purpose stated in the sixth section. . THIS case came before the court, in the first instance, on a certificate of division in opinion in the circuit, court of the United States for the southern district of New York. On inspecting the record, it appeared that on the trial of the cavfse in the circuit court, the- counsel for the defendants had excepted to the decisions of the court on various matters which. had been presented for the consideration of the court  and that a bill of exceptions had been sealed by the court on their motion. The. record proceeded to state, that the cause afterwards came on for -argument on a motion for a new trial, when the opinions of the two judges of the circuit court were opposed upon questions, presented for the decision of the court, exeepr ted to on the trial, as stated.in the bill of exceptions:  that upon the questions thus occurring before the court, the opinions of the said two judges were opposed  and upon request of the counsel for the plaintiffs, the points upon which the disagreement happened, were stated under the direction of the judges, and certified under the s' al of the court to the Supreme Court.  Mr Webster stated, that a question, preliminary to the argument df the case, was presented for the decision of the court. It was, whether the court would entertain the case as it came up from the circuit court on a division in that court on a motion for a now, trial. This court had exercised their right to decide in cases where the opinions of the judges of the circuit court on questions of law had  been opposed, when a motion for a new trial was before the court, Mr Justice Story. In the cases referred to, the division of the court took place on the trial of the cause before the jury, as well as on the motion for a new, trial. Mr Chief Justice Marshall suggested -that the case might be brought on if the parties would agree that it-should stand as if a judgment had been given by the circuit court on the exceptions. The case, he  said, could not be heard on a difference in opinion of the judges of the court, on a .motion for anew trial. The counsel for the plaintiffs and defendants having agreed that the case should stand as suggested by the chief justice, and an agreement in writing to that effect having been filed, the' court made the following order. It is now here by the court considered and ordered, that this cause shall now be heard.and decided, as on a writ of error brought after verdict and judgment in the circuit court, on the exceptions which were taken in that court  that the cause shall now proceed, as if judgment had been actually entered in the circuit court for the plaintiffs there, and that the certificate in the case shall be taken, regarded and treated as a writ of error, sued out by the defendants below, on the judgment of the circuit court, and that the question shall be, as in other cases, wheth r the said judgment ought to be reversed or affirmed: but that this court will reserve its opinion and judgment in this cause till the defendants in the court below shall have sued out a writ of error in this cause to the said circuit court, and filed a return thereto, with a bill of exceptions in this cause, in the usual form, signed by the court below, in this court'. The case came on for argument, after the   defendants had sued out a writ of error on a judgment entered in the circuit court for the plaintiffs, in conformity with the suggestion and order of this court. The case was as follows: The action was brought to recover damages for an alleged infringement of a patent right, and came on for trial in the circuit court in November 1828, when a verdict was rendered for the plaintiffs for three thousand two hundred and sixty-six dollars sixty-six cents. The plaintiffs gave in evidence a patent from the United States, in the following terms, the same being the patent declared upon:.   Whereas Joseph Grant, a citizen of the United States, hath alleged that he hath invented a new and useful improvement in the mode of manufacturing hat bodies by the combination of motions, viz. the rotatory and revolving motion, with the vibrating or transverse motion, which forms the two hat bodies by machinery, and crosses the wool from one extremity of the hat bodies to the other at one operation, called Grant s improved winding machine for setting up hat bodies  his former patent for the same invention, dated the 11th day of August 1821, having been cancelled, owing to the defective specification on which the same was granted   which improvement he states had not been known or used b fore his application   hath made oath that he does verily believe that he is the true inventor or discoverer of the said improvement  hath paid into the tr asury of the United States the sum of thirty dollars, delivered a receipt for the same, and presented a petition to the secretary of state, signifying a desire of obtaining an exclusive property in the said improvement, and praying that a patent may be granted for that purpose.   These are, therefore, to grant, according to law,, to the said Joseph Grant, his heirs, administrators or assigns, for the term pf fourteen years, from the 11th day of August 1821, the full and exclusive right and liberty of making,'constructing, using, and vending to others to be used, the said improvement, a description whereof is given in the words of the said Joseph Grant himself in  he schedule hereunto annexed, and is made a part of these presents. In testimony whereof, I have caused these letters to be made patent, and the seal of the United States to be hereunto affixed.

City of Washington, to wit:   1 do hereby certify, that the foregoing letters patent were delivered to me oh the 28th day of April in the year of our Lord 1825, to be examined  that I have examined the same, and find them conformable to law, and I do hereby return the same to the secretary of state within fifteen days from the date aforesaid, to wit, on this28th day of April,' in the year aforesaid. William Wirt, Attorney General of the U. S. The schedule referred to in these letters patent,  i d making part of the same, contained a description, in the words of the saidi Joseph Grant himself, of his improvement in the mode of manufacturing hat bodies by the combination of motions, viz  the rotary or revolving motion, with the vibrating or transverse motion, which forms the two hat bodies by machinery, and crosses the wool from one extremity of the hat bodies to the other at one operation, called Grant s improved winding machine for setting up. hat bodies  his. former patent for the same-invention, dated on the 11th day of August, A.D. 1821, having been cancelled, owing to the defective specification on which the same was granted. The schedule, which contained a full description of the invention, and of the mode of using it, was also given in evidence. The counsel for the plaintiffs also produced and read in evidence a certificate of the secretary of state, duly authenticated under his hand and official seal, and certain papers thereto annexed, in the words and figures following: To all to whom these'presents shall come, greeting: I certify th t the annexed is a true copy of the record of cancellation of a patent granted to Joseph Grant on the 11th of August 1821, and cancelled on the 28th of April, A. D. 1825  also, that the .annexed is a true copy-of the petition prayirig for the cancellation, and the issuing of another patent for the same invention. In testimony whereof, I, Henry Clay, secretary of state of the United States, have hereunto subscribed my came, and caused the seal of the department of state to be affixed.

This patent was returned to the patent office, the seal broken, and now stands cancelled, owing to the defective specification, on which it was issued, and another, patent granted (with a corrected specification), on the38th day of April 1825, bearing date with the first, and for the same invention.   The -petition of Joseph Grant, of Providence, in the county of Providence, and state of Rhode Island, hatter,, a citizen of the United States of America, respectfully. represents, that your petitioner has invented a new and useful improvement in the mode of manufacturing hat-bodies by the combination of motions, viz. the rotatory or revolving motion with the vibrating or traverse motion, which forms the two hat bodies by machinery, and crosses the wool fropi one extremity of the hat oodies to the other at one operation, called   Grant s improved winding machine for setting up hat bodies,  according to the specification, explanations, and drawings, herewith- presented  which the subscriber prays may be taken as a part of his petition   an improvement not used or known before his application,, the advantages of which your petitioner is desirous of securing to himself and his legal representatives. Your petitioner would further state, that he has, heretofore, viz. on the 11th day of August, A.D. 1821,- obtained letters patent from the president of the United States for his said improvement, but, owing to a defective specification on which the same were granted, he prays that the said patent may be cancelled, and a new and correct, one granted, embracing the same improvements, so far as the same are set forth, in the accompanying specification, drawing, and explanations. Your petitioner therefore prays that letters patent of the United States may be issued, granting to your petitioner, his(heirs, administrators, or assigns, the full and exclusivefight of making, constructing, using, and vending to others to be used, his!said improvement, according to the specification and drawings hereto annexed, agreeably to the act of congress in such case made and provided  your petitioner having paid thirty dollars into th^. treasury of the United States, and complied with other provisions of the said act. As in duty bound, will ever pray. Joseph Grant. To the' Hon. Henry Clay, Secretary of State of the United States of America. Providence, April 20, 1825. As the assignee of David Curtis,' who was the assignee of Joseph Grant, of one moiety of the original patent, I finite in the prayer of the above petitioner, that the original patent may be cancelled, and a new-one granted to the said Joseph Grant, as above set forth. Solomon Townsend. To the Hon. Henry Clay, Secretary of State of the United States of America. Providence, April 20, 1825., The counsel for the defendant objected that the secretary of state had no power, by law, to accept a surrender of and to cancel said letters patent, or to inquire into or decide upon the causes for so doing, or to grant said second.patent for the same invention, with an amended specification, .for the unexpended portion of the term of fourteen years, which had been granted by the first patent. The court decided that such surrender might be made, when the defect in the specification arose from inadvertence or mistake, and without any fraud or misconduct on the part of the patentee  and that the secretary of state had authority to  ccept. such surrender, and cancel the record of the patent, and to issue a new patent for the unexpired part of the fourteen years granted under the old patent in manner aforesaid. To which decision the counsel for the defendant excepted. The fourth plea, filed on the part of the defendant, after reciting the specification, annexed to the patent of the plaintiffs, averred as follows:  and the defendants aver that said specification does not correctly or accurately describe the improvement claimed.by the said Joseph Grant as his invention  but said specification, and the drawings thereto annexed, are altogether defective in this, among other things, namely: in said specification no proportions, sizes, of distances, are given, and the bigness or size of none of the principal parts of said machine is given in said specifications or drawings, but the same is wholly omitted  and, in other particulars, said specification .and drawings, ar  altogether defective. And the defendants aver that said specification  annexed to and making part of said letters patent, with the drawings thereto annexed, do net contain a written description of his, the said Joseph Grant s invention and improvement aforesaid, and manner of using if, in such foil,, clear, ar.d exact terms as to distinguish the same from all other things   before known, and so as to enable any person skilled in the art of which said machine or improvement is-51 brand), or with which it is most.nearly connected, to make-and use lhe same  and that,'for the cause aforesaid, Said-letters patent are void. All which the defendants-are ready to verify  wherefore they pray judgment if the said Joseph Grant and Solomon Towmsend ought to have or maintain their aforesaid action against  hem, and for their costa   To which plea the following replication was filed:. And as to the said plea of the said Eliakim Raymond and Henry Raymond, by them fourthly above pleaded, the- said Joseph Grant and Solomon Townsend say, that, by reason of any thing in the said Iasi mentioned  pleaalleged, they ought not to be barred from having and maintaining their aforesaid action thereof against them, the said Eliakim Raymond and Henry Raymond, because they say that the specification mentioned in the said last mentioned plea does correctly and accurately describe the improvement claimed   by the said Joseph Grant, as his invention - and because they say .further,,that neither the said specification, nor the drawings thereto annexed, are defective in any of the particulars in that behalf alleged in the said last mentioned plea  and this they, the said Joseph Grant and Solomon Townsend, pray may he inquired of by the country  and the said Eliakim Raymond and Henry Raymond do the like, &c. The counsel, for the defendants on the said trial introduced sundry witnesses to .prove the allegations traversed in the said fourth plea, and insisted that they had proved the same, and that the'said specification of-the said Joseph Grant did not describ  the improvement which he claimed to have invented, in such full, clear, and exact terms as to distinguish the same from-all other things before known, nor so as to enable a person skilled in the art or science of which it is a branch, or with-which it is-most nearly connected, to make and use. the same  and-they requested the court to charge the. jury, that if they found that* the defendants. had' maintained and proved, their averments in that respect, that they must find the same for the defendants   which instructions'fte court refused to give, but instructed the jury that the patent would not be void on this, ground, unless such defectivo 91  imperfect specification or de-. scription arose from design, add for the purpose of deceiving' the public  to which opinion the counsel for the  defendants also excepted. The case was argued by Mr Webster, for the defendants in the circuit court, now befor  the court as plaintiffs in   tsrror  and. by Mr Ogden, for the defendants, plaintiffs in the circuit court. Mr Webster stated, that the first question for the decision of the court, was whether the secretary of state can accept the. surrender of a .patent, cancel it, and   grant a new one for the unexpired ter-m for which a patent had been granted, on a. suggestion that the specification is defective through inadvertence or mistake? It cannot but be doubted whether such cancellation can be made any where, so as to take out a new patent. The whole system of patents rests on statute provision. There is no common law power, or prerogative right, in the president to issued patent. In this particul r, our.law is different from the English. Ours is a statute grant  theirs is an emanation out,of a statute prohibition.. With us, the fountain is statute  with them,prerogative. Our statute makes no provision for'any surrender, and the issuing of a new patent thereon. Indeed, it Seems impossible to reconcile such a proceeding to the requisitions of the act. How can the patentee allege, or assign for his second patent, that his improvement had not been known before that application. - That is a statute requisition   here, in the case . before the court, it had been in use three years. The party .must claim, and in this case does claim, under his .second patent, as a new and substantive patent  not under his first, with an amended specification. On surrender Or cancellation of the patent, the party comes for a new patent, for the same invention. Now, in all such' cases, it must be that the thing has been used or known before that application. In this very case, it doe's not appear that nis petition contained the statute requisitesj it refers it to his former application. But however this may be, the secretary of state has no authority to make a record of cancellation, and. to issue a new patent. The secretary of state is a   merely ministeri l officer. All the laws relating to granting patents regard him as merely ministerial. His department is denominated an executive department. He has no where any particle of judicial power. On the- subject of patents, as well as all others, he acts wholly ministerially. By the first patent law, April 10, 1790, the secretaries of state, war, and attorney-general, were invested with authority to grant or refuse patents. But this was repealed by the existing law of February 21, 1793. The power of granting or withholding patents, was bf this act taken away from every body. The secretary was to give the patent out, on certain requisitions being complied with, without exercising any judgment, or making any inquiry  and the patent was to avail the grantee what it might, according to the truth of the representations of the patentee. It is matter of right, and matter of course, to issue the patent  if the requisites of the law be complied with. The. secretary has nothing to do but make out the patent. He is applied to as keeper of the seal. And if a dispute arises between inventors, the secretary cannot decide it  he is to appoint umpires. Sect. 9. He is not trusted to decide even whether the form of the letters patent be conformable to law  that belongs to .the attorney-general. The general power of'the secretary is commented on in Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch, 159, 160. He is to record diplomatic transactions  but he cannot alter or cancel those records. He records treaties and acts of congress  but those, of course, he cannot alter. The secretary has no power to record in his office any transaction, not his own, except so far as authorised by statute. In regard to patents, the statute declares what shall be recorded. . 1. The patent itself, 2. The assignment of it, if requested. These are all. The secretary has nothing more to do. As to cancelling a patent, he is functus officio. The breaking the seal, or other cancellation'by the patentee of his patent, is just as effectual if done any where else as if done at the' state department. It is not a transaction which the law has prescribed for recording any where. He can neither authorise this cancellation  nor forbid it  nor make it matter of official record. The vacating and cancelling the reeordof a patent is in its nature a judicial act. The act of 1793 treats it as such, and provides tioo modes of such vacation. Cited the 6th and 10th sections of the act. The common law, also, provides a mode. The court cannot add a rieus section to the act. In England, the repealing of patents' is always regarded as a judicial act. Godson on Patents, 200. The limitations, under which the eoifrt below1 thought the secretary could vacate one patent and issue another, show that the power he is expected to exercise is judicial. The defect must arise from inadvertence or mistake, without fraud or misconduct. The .power of the secretary to act, then, depends upon his having adjudged the case to be one of mistake, and not a case of fraud. This is judicial power. ,   How can the secretary make this judicial investigation. . 1.- He has no parties before him, and no power to bring persons before him. When done in court, this is done in the presence of litigant parties. 2. He cannot summon witnesses before him, and if they should come voluntarily, lie 6an-not administer an oath to them. Such oaths would be extrajudicial and nugatory. He cannot require the party s own oath. Now, whether the want o.f a proper specification be the  ffect of accident or of fraud, is a question of fact  and it is to be decided by the secretary, Without parties, oaths or witnesses. Besides, the surrender is to be accepted only when the specification is defective. Is not that very question a question of fact, or a mixed question of law and fact? Certainly if is.. It is for the jury: even a court cannot .determine it without ajury. By act.of April 20th, 1818, the secretary of state appoints a superintendent. Does he delegate to him his judicial power? There is but one way of answering this view of the subject. It must be contended, that, in every case/on the mere suggestion of the patentee, a new-patent is to bo issued for the resir due of the term, with an amended specification: leaving it to be decided  when suit should be brought, whether the defect was inadvertent or fraudulent. ' This would change the whole patent system. Its effects would be monstrous. Patentees would try' their claims under one specification  they might fail  and they would call it madvertence, and try another experiment. A man builds an expensive factory, puts in costly machinery, not patented, not described in any specification  he expends much money  by and by, he is sued for violating a patent, and he finds that- since he built, an old patent has come out with a new specification. A hearing, of which he knew nothing, has been had before the secretary, and a new patent has issued, and he is called on to stop his factory. Now this supposed case is the very case before the Court, The defendants erected their works in .1823, 1S24. They knew of the plaintiff s patent of August 11, lS21, but it did not describe any machinery.used by them. But in 1825 he surrendered his first patent, took out another, with a specification describing their machinery, and sued them. Under the direction of the court he has recovered a verdict for.three thousand two hundred and sixty-six dollars  and is entitled, of course, to- ha-ve this trebled, and the defendants are ruined. Is this legal? A bill in equity is pending also, to stop the defendants  factory'. Now', what reason is there for saying that defendants shall suffer these losses, even by the mistake or inadvertence of the patented. The invention hacl bceome public, and if not protected by the first patent, it was.gone forever, A bad patent is no patent! 1 Barn. & Ald. 386. It may be well for congress to give the courts or judges power to vacate' patents on patentee s own motion  but then congress would provide lim> tations and securities for innocent persons. On the doctrine of this case there-are no securities. What are- the consequences of such a principle? A man finds out there are other machines made like his, which he would like to stop  he sets up inadvertence, gets a new patent, and stops them. If he swears, it, who can deni/ it? It is of younger date, and he swears he meant to describe it. This would furnish irresistible temptation to perjury. There is a deeper objection. A man makes an invention  he gets a patent, but his specification does not-describe it, but describes something else. In the meantime, the public use, hot what he has patented, but what' li  has.'not.' Now, how is the public to be deprived  f the use of this ? It is denied that they can 'be prevented this use. The decision  f this court in Pennock v. Dialogue, proves this cannot be. The invention was-used and known before it was patented. A patent, not describing an invention, is void as to that invention, and does not protect it. The invention, by a single month s use, unprotected by a patent, becomes public property and can never be resumed. Whether the patent be void through fraud or inadvertence, if it does not describe the invention, then the invention is not protected, but has become public property. Pennock v. Dialogue so decides. In England a scire facias to repeal a patent is a criminal proceeding, and does not allow costs. 7 Term Rep. 367  Godson, 201. This case was tried in New  York before Pennock v. Dialogue was decided in this court. . The only case applicable to the one how before the court is Morris v. Huntington, 1 Paine, 348. That was decided in 1824. Its- doctrine was materially changed, by Pennock and Dialogue. After all, that case only decides, that a patent, while another is in existence, is void. The judge then goes on to say, it-may be surrendered. It seems admitted that the new patent ought not to reach back so as to affect those who had airead}' used the invention. But how can this distinction be made? . Cited to this point, Brooke v. Clarke, 1 B. and A. 396, note. The great and conclusive,objection is this  the new patent is granted on the new application, and the invention had been public four years. This is fully settled in  he case of Pennock v. Dialogue. ' The second point is presented on the defendants  fourth plea. The court instructed the jury that the patent would not be void, unless the defective or imperfect specification arose from design, or the purpose of deceiving the. public. This point presents two questions. 1. Whether the patent would be void or not, for the reasons stated  the direction of the court was not pertinent to the issue. The parties Were at issue on a question bf fact  witnesses were examined, and counsel had summed up  but the court told the jury the issue was immaterial, and under this question the jury found a verdict for plaintiff. It can require no argument to prove that this is an illegal direction. 2 Day s Reports, 519  1 Starkie, 388  9 Cranch, 339, 355. 2. If the question had legally arisen, the law was wrongly stated. It is insisted, that the plea was a good bar. If the specification was defective, as set forth in the plea, the plaintiff could not recover, whether that defect arose from accident or design. The very words of the third section of the statute require this. There are certain conditions precedent to be complied with, before an inventor can obtain a patent. This is one of them. The .language of this section is emphatic and absolute  it could not be stronger. Courts may just as well dispense with the oath. Suppose he omit to deliver any written specification whatever  can he afterwards say that omission was owing to inadvertence? Yet a defective, or bad specification, is no specifi.cation. The same law that requires a written specification, requires a full and accurate one. A defective one is ho better than none at all. Suppose he omit to sign the specification, can that be cured?  A party is to describe his invention so as to answer two purposes: 1. To' distinguish it from all other things before known. 2.   To enable any person skilled in' the art to make and use it. If he fail in either of these, he fails in a condition precedent. This is all very clear, and there would be no doubt about it but for the sixth section. That section has been supposed to raise the doubt. This section  as has been observed by most judges, is inarifully drawn. It speaks of the right of a defendant to give this act in evidence, in an action founded on the act itself. It is not grammatical. It seems borrowed from the law of 1791. The first important remark is, that the preceding sections have described the whole extent of the patentee s right. This section has for its object, the giving of immunities and protection to those who may be sued by patentees. Therefore, its object was not to enlarge the right of patentees. Second, most of. its provisions are only affirmative, and the right existed before. The action being case, all the material defences are competent. Third, it gives some matters as a defence not mentioned in the first act, such as license or abandonment to the public. Fourth, it does not repeat the same objections to specification. It allows the defendant to prove three things as fatal defects in his specification. 1. That it does not contain the whole truth relative to the discovery, with intent to deceive the public. This provision may stand with the first section. 2. That it contains more than is necessary to produce the described effect  with intent to deceive the public. This may stand with the third section. 3. That the thing had been used, or described in a public work. This may also stand. Now, the fraudulent intent is applied only to the two first. In these cases congress may say that fraud shall be proved  because, even with' these defects, it may be a patent, and a very useful patent. It may be a valid patent, though the patentee take it but for part of his invention  yet if he fraudulently deceive the public by keeping part back, it shall be void. So it may be a good and valuable patent, though it contain more than is necessary to product) the described effect. But if it be not so described as to be distinguished from other.things before known, or so that skilful persons can use it, it is no patent, or of no use at all. These last objections go to its very existence  and are therefore made prerequisites. They are absolute conditions precedent. But the main consideration yet is, that this sixth section has an object of its own. It looks, not so much to the defence in its suits, as to the judicial vacation of the patent. It does not look mainly to the defence of the suits, because it leaves out several known grounds of defence.   1. License. 2. Abandonment to the public. 3. That the patent is broader than the invention. 4. That the machine is not well described. All these are defences, and yet not mentioned here. The object of the sixth section is like that.of the tenth, to repeal for fraud proved. All this may stand, without contradicting the third section, or doing violence to its language. Indeed, Pennock and Dialogue, 2 Peters, 1, has apparently decided, this. The sixth'section speaks of inventions known before the patenteds discovery. This does not contradict the third section     known before application.  The court has settled this, and it decides this case. The plaintiff relied below on the following eases. Park v. Little and Wood, 3 Washington, 196, in April 1813  Gray et al. v. James, 1 Peters s C. C. Rep. 401, 1817. But it does not appear in this case whether the defendant was or was n&t proceeding with a view to vacate the patent. Most probably he was  for at-that time such was .the practice. This is rendered still'more probable by a decision looking the other way in 1820, by the same judge. Kneass v. Schuylkill Bank  4 Wash. C. C. Rep. 13. This case is clearly for the plaintiffs in error. The case of Whittemore v. Cutter, 1 Gallison, 419, decided in May 1813, was probably a case to vacate  at any rate the judges doubted, and would have divided if the case had-turned on this point. The case of Lowell v. Lewis, 1 Mason, 183, in 1817, was probably a similar case ' page 189 cited particularly. How can the court dispense with the express words' of the third section. Here they are put into the form of a special plea  can they be disregarded? Suppose there be but one.witness  though this is merely a fdrmal requisit , can the court dispense'with it? Besides, why should the statute require a specification, unless it was to be full and accurate? For what-purpose should an insufficient specification be enjoined? The court may as well say there shall be none.. The statute says as imperatively what -the specification shall contain, as that there shall be. a specification at all. If an imperfect or defective specification does not-render a patent void, what harm does it do to it? Let this question be answered.   Now, the patentee says his specification in 1821 was defective, not through fraud, but defective. But why was not that patent good, or this? If defective through fraud he eduld not get another. It must be presumed to be defective through inadvertence. If so, what need of a new one? Compare the two rules of law decided in this case together. 1. The judge held, that party might surrender his patent and take a new one, when the specification in the first was defective through mistake, and without fraud. 2. The court ruled, that though a specification be altogether defective, yet the jiatent is not void, unless such defect arise from design. How can these things stand together? If the last proposition be true, all inquiry about the first is idle  unless the question be, whether a man having one good patent may surrender it and take out another good one for the same thing. It is now matter of settled law, that if a patent bq broader than the invention it is void  and it is never inquired-whether this arise from design or accident, in nine times out of ten it arises front inadvertence.   Now, on what principle is this ? Not because the plaintiff s invention has not beeii invaded. It may have been exactly copied. It is because he has not rightly described what he claimed, and therefore his patent protects him in nothing. So if a patent be for an improvement, of an old machine, it must state the improvement accurately, and distinguish between what is old and what new. Finally, the English statute has always been construed the other way. Our sixth section is a substitute for the English scire facias. Cited Davis s Patent Cases, 413  Godson, 124  Holroyd, 100, note.

The first, question is, whether the secretary of state of the United States has a power by law to accept of the surrender of and to cancel a patent which had on,ce been issued, and to grant a second patent for the same invention, with an amended specification for the unexpired portion of the term of fourteen years which had been granted by the first patent? Upon this question, there is not known a single case where the point has been expressly decided in the United States. The patent law is silent upon the subject  and the question must then be decided upon general principles. A patent for a useful machine is a grant of the exclusive privilege of making and using the machine for a limited time. Now it would seem that a grantee may surrender his grant. A man who has a privilege may surrender that privilege. If a man cancels his patent upon record, it amounts to a surrender of it. The difficulty in the question, if there be any, must be in the other branch of it. Has the secretary of state the power after the surrender of one patent to grant a new one for the same invention, with an amended specification for the unexpired portion of the term of fourteen years which had been granted by the first patent? Why should he not? When the first patent is cancelled, the invention is unprotected. If a useful one, why should not the inventor have the benefit of it? He certainly never intended to abandon the benefit of. it to the public. His first patent is evidence of that. A specification requires t'o be drawn with great accuracy. Mechanics, by whom machines are usually invented, it cannot be supposed are capable of drawing a proper specification. Can it be supposed that the law ever -intended to punish their ignorance in drawing a very special legal paper by a forfeiture of all the advantages of their invention? It is apprehended that the issuing a new patent in England, where there has been no sufficient speaification to comply with the condition of the first patent, is pretty much a matter of course. In the case Ex parte Beck, 1 Bro. Ch. Rep. 575, the lord chancellor says,   that perhaps upon the petitioner s applying for a new patent, the officers might, under these circumstances, be.induced to remit their fees  but that he could give no relief upon the present petition.  Here the lord chancellor speaks <3f the issuing of a new patent as a matter of course. In our patent law, the inventor must file his specification before he can procure his patent. In England, the patent contains upon its face a condition -that if the patentee shall not make and file a specification within a limited- time after the date of the patent, then the patent, and all the liberties and advantages under it, shall cease and be void. One  f thevcases cited by the plaintiff in error shows that the specification is not filed within, the time mentioned in the patent  although the patent is void, a new one may be t^ken out by the inventor for the same invention. This case, in principle, seems to support the proposition for which the defendant in error contends  that if a first patent is void for want of a specification, or for want of a sufficient specification, a new one may be issued for the same invention to the same inventor. In the case of Morris v. Huntington, 1 Paine s. Rep. of Cases in the Second Circuit, 355, Mr Justice Thompson says,   I see no insuperable objection to entering a vacatur of the patent of record in the department of state, if taken out inadvertently, or .by mistake. All the proceedings in that department on the subject of patents are ex parte, except in the case of interfering applications. The department acts rather ministerially than judicially, and upon the representation of the applicant, without entering into an examination of the question of right  and there seems to be no good reason why on a like ex parle application, the patent may not be. surrendered and cancelled of record, if no misconduct be imputable to the patentee in taking it out.  Cited also page 356. So far then as this question has ever arisen in any of our courts, the right to surrender an old patent and procure a new-one has been recognized. Cited also Barrett et al. v. Hall, l Mason, 475, as to the second point. The second point is settled by the express terms of the patent law, and by the adjudications which have taken place under it. 1. By the express terms of the patent law. The sixth section of the patent act declares,   that the defendant shall be permitted to plead the general issue, and give this act and any special matter in evidence, of which notice in writing must have been given, &c. thirty days before the trial  tending to prove that the -specification filed by the plaintiff does not contain the.whole truth relative to the discovery, or that it contains more than is'necessary to produce the described effect, which concealment or addition shall fully appear to have been made for the purpose of deceiving the public, fyc. fyc. So, therefore, if the specification does not contain the whole truth relative, to the discovery, or if it contains more than is necessary to produce'- the described effect, the patent shall not, for these causes, or either of them, be evidence unless   the concealment or addition shall fully appear to have been  made for.the purpose of deceiving the public.  2. By the adjudications which have taken place under the law. The first case in which the question came up, was the case of Whitney v. Carter, in the circuit court of Georgia. That case is cited in Mr Fessenden s Essay on the Law of Patents, 123. His honour, Judge Johnson, in charging the jury in that case, said,  he considered the defendants second objection equally unsupported, and referred to the sixth section of the patent law, by which it is required that the concealment alleged (in order to defeat the patentee s recovery) must appear to have been made for the purpose of deceiving the public. That Mr Whitney could have no motive for such concealment,  &c. &c. In the case of Gray and Osgood v. James et al. 1 Peters s C. C. Rep. 394, this question came up before the circuit court in Pennsylvania. Judge Washington says,  but if the jury-should be of opinion that the specification is materially defective, the objection will not- be sufficient to invalidate the plaintiff s patent, unless they should also be satisfied that the concealment of the circumstances not described, was intended to deceive the public.  In the case of Whittemore v. Cutter, 1 Gallis. 429, Mr Justice-Story says,   any defect or concealment in a specification to avoid a patent, must arise from an intention to deceive the public.  In the case of Lowell v. Lewis, 1 Mass. 189, the same learned judge makes a similar declaration.\n",

      "judges:   parties:  SULLIVAN v. REDFIELD et al. opinions:  THOMPSON, Circuit Justice. The application in this case is for an injunction to restrain the defendants and their associates from navigating the steam boat Commerce and safety barge Lady Clinton, which the bill alleges they are doing in violation of a patent right of the complain nt. The application comes before the court on notice of the motion duly served. The defendants have appeared by their counsel, but have read no affidavits, or shown any thing in opposition to the motion, except what arises upon the bill itself. Nor has the complainant fortified his application with any thing except what is contained in his bill. It is presumed that the bill has been sworn to, though even that does not appear. Under this state of the case, an objection has been made, which may be considered in some measure as a question of practice, viz.: Whether the bill should not be accompanied by an affidavit, that the complainant believes himself to be the original inventor of what he claims under his patent. The bill in this case does not allege, that the complainant is the original inventor  so that admitting it- to have been sworn to, there is no verification under oath, that he believes himself to be the original inventor. That it is material to his claim, that he should be the inventor, cannot be denied. It is the only ground upon which the patent right can be sustained. It is said, however, on the part of the complainant, that the oath required to be made by the patentee, before he can obtain his patent, is at least prima facie evidence that he is the inventor or discoverer. The weight that ought to be given to this oath may depend on circumstances. The court will certainly not presume that the patentee, when he made the oath, did not believe himself to be the true inventor or discoverer. But the question it not whether at that time he was under such belief, but whether he is still under that belief when he seeks to enforce his patent right. In the present case the patent was granted in the year 1S16, and the patentee may since that time have obtained such information respecting the invention, that he could not now swear that he believes himself to be the inventor of what he claims  and there may be some question whether the established practice of the  court does not require such an affidavit, when application is made for an injunction. Among the rules of practice adopted by the supreme court of the United States, for the courts of equity, in February term, IS22, it is by the 33d rule provided, that  in all eases where the rules prescribed by this court or by the circuit courts do not apply, the practice of the circuit courts shall be regulated by the practice of the high court of chancery in England.  And in the ease of Hill v. Thompson. 3 Mer. 624. decided in the year 1817. Lord Eldon said, that when in future an injunction is applied for ex parte, on the ground of a violation of a right to an invention secured by patent, it must be understood, that it is incumbent on the party making the application to swear, at the time of making it, as to his belief that he is the original inventor. For although when he obtained his patent he might very honestly have sworn to his belief of such being the fact, yet circumstances may have subsequently intervened, or information have been communicated sufficient to convince him, that it was not his own original invention, and that he was under a mistake, when he made his previous declaration to that effect. We think there is great good sense in this rule, and that it applies with peculiar force to a case where the patentee has slept for a great length of time upon his naked patent right without carrying it into practical use. The present case, however, cannot be considered as coming strictly within this rule. The application is not altogether ex parte. It is made on notice of the motion, and has been resisted by counsel, and wras open to the hearing of opposing affidavits. We do not therefore mean to dispose of the application upoD this point  although we think the reason and good sense of the rule is applicable to the case, and would suggest it as fit and proper to be adopted in all cases where the bill does not allege the complainant to be the original inventor.  Whether the complainant s patent is good and valid so as ultimately to secure to him the right he claims, is not a question for decision upon the equity side of this court. That is a question which belongs to a court of law, in which the parties have a right of trial by a jury. The equity jurisdiction exercised by' the court over patents for inventions is merely in aid of the common law. and in order to give more complete effect to the provisions of the statute under which the patent is granted. And this jurisdiction should, of course, -never be exercised but upon the supposition, that the applicant for the aid of the court, has a right, which has been infringed by the party against whom the injunction is prayed. It is not a matter of course to grant an injunction upon the mere exhibition of the patent, and an allegation that it has been infringed. The patent may be. upon a trial at law, prima facie evidence of the right. But in order to warrant an interference by injunction, there ought to be but little, if any doubt in the minds of the court as to the validity of the patent, especially where the case rests entirely upon the complainant s own showing, without any opposing testimony. It has been urged on the part of the complainant, that under the provisions of the act of congress of the 15th of February, 1810 [3 Stat. 481], the patent itself gives to the patentee a right to claim the interference of this court by injunction. That act declares,  that the circuit courts of the United St tes shall have original cognizance, as well in equity as at law, of all actions, suits, controversies, and cases, arising under any law of the United States, granting or confirming to authors or inventors, the exclusive right to their respective 'writings, inventions, and discoveries. And upon any bill in equity, filed by any party aggrieved in any such cases, shall have authority to grant injunctions, according to the course and principles of courts of equity, to prevent the violation of the rights of any authors or inventors, &c. on such terms and conditions as the said courts may deem fit and reasonable.  This act does not enlarge or alter the powers of the court over the subject matter of the bill or the cause of action. It only extends its jurisdiction to parties not before falling within it. Before this act it had been held, that a citizen of one state could not obtain an injunction in the circuit court for a violation of a patent right against a citizen of the same state, as no act of congress authorized such suit. [Livingston. v. Van Ingen, Case No. 8,420.] This act removed that objection, and gave the jurisdiction, although the parties were citizens of the same state. But in the exercise of the jurisdiction in all cases of granting injunctions to prevent the violation of patent rights, the court is to proceed according to the course and principles of courts of equity in such cases. So that the questions presented in the present case are precisely where they would have been without this .act. In support of the present application, much reliance has been placed upon the case of Livingston v Van Ingen, 9 Johns. 507, decided in the court of errors of this state. But a little consideration will show there is no analogy between the two cases. The right of Livingston and Fulton was founded upon acts of the legislature, which were clear and unambiguous. And if those acts were considered valid and constitutional, no doubt could exist as to the right. There were no facts in dispute, nor could any arise, upon which it was requisite for a jury to decide. There was. therefore, no necessity, or propriety, in sending the parties into a court of law to establish their right. That right depended solely on the constitutionality of the statutes under which it was claimed. This question belonged exclusively to the court, and not to a jury to decide  and which question, if sent to a court for trial, would, according to the course of the courts of this state, come back again for ultimate decision to the tribunal where it then was. And independent of this, Livingston and Fulton had been in the actual and exclusive enjoyment. and practical exercise of their right for at least three years. It will be in vain to look for the circumstances in the present case to support the analogy. The right, in point of law. is, to say the least, doubtful. Some of the questions involved in the inquiry are exclusively for a jury  and the allegations in the bill, as to the practical exercise and enjoyment of the right claimed, are vague and ambiguous. In what particulars the complainant s application is open to these objections, will hereafter be noticed. We would not be understood as having formed, nor do we mean to express, any decided opinion upon the validity of the patent. We only notice the objections to it, so far as may be proper and necessary to regulate our judgment in determining, whether such a case is presented as to entitle the complainant to an injunction. according to the course and principles of courts of equity in like cases. The rule in the English court of chancery, on this subject, is: That where a patent has been granted, and there has been an exclusive possession of some duration under it, the court will interpose its injunction, without putting the parry previously to establish the validity of his patent at law. But when the patent is recent, and upon an application for an injunction, it is endeavoured to be shown, in opposition to it. that there is no good specification, or otherwise, that the patent ought not to have been granted, the court will not, from its own notions respecting the matter in dispute, act upon the presumed validity or invalidity of the patent, without the right having been ascertained by a previous trial  but will send the patentee to law, and oblige him to establish the validity of his patent in a court of law, before it will grant him the benefit of an injunction. 3 Mer. 624. And we are not aware of any decisions in the courts of the United States, dr in those of any of the states, which are at variance with this rule. We will proceed then briefly to notice how far it applies to the present case: and first, as to the objections taken to the patent and specification. We have not the patent before us  and all that the bill states of its contents is, that on the 4th day of December. 1816, the complainant obtained letters patent  for a new and useful improvement in the steam tow-boat.  This grant presupposes the knowledge and use of a steam tow-boat, of which the pat-entee does not claim to be the inventor, but his patent is for an improvement in such steam tow-boat. The bill sets out the specification, and so far as it contains a description of the complainant s invention, is as follows:  I claim, as my invention, the ap plication of steam engine power, placed in one vessel, to the towing, or drawing after her, another vessel, for the purpose of conveying thereon, passengers, or merchandise, or either of them, being a new application of a known power. The manner in which this application may be made, varies with the circumstances in some  measure, but essentially consists in attaching the packet to the  steam-boat, with ropes, chains, or spars, so as to communicate the power of the engines from the towing vessel to vessels taken in tow, and kept always at convenient distance.  This specification is obviously broader than the patent. The latter is for  an improvement in the steam tow-boat  and the former contains a description of the steam tow-boat itself  of which the complainant claims to be the inventor, according to his specification. The patent and specification are connected together and dependent on each other for support. The specification should maintain the title of the patent. The latter should not indicate one thing and the former describe another, as the subject of the grant. Gods. Pat. 102-10G  2 Barn. & Aid. 350. Both the language and the policy of the act of congress require that the specification should be clear, plain, and intelligible. so that others may be taught by it to make, or do the thing for which the patent is granted. The object of the specification is to inform the public, after the expiration of the term for which the patent is granted, what the invention is: and it ought, therefore, to put the public in possession of whatever is necessary to the use and enjoyment thereof. Does this specification contain any such certainty of description? It states that the manner in which the power is to be applied, varies with the circumstances in some measure. Nothing could be more vague and uncertain than this description. But it adds,  that it essentially consists in attaching the packet to the steam-boat with ropes,  chains, or spars  so as to communicate the power of the engine from the towing vessel to vessels taken in tow. and kept always  at convenient distance.  On the argument much stress was laid on the word  attaching.  It was said to signify a fixed and solid union between the two boats, which distinguished it from the ordinary towing in common use. which was called connecting the two boats by some temporary fastening. IVe are not aware of any such distinction between the two terms, as to draw after it such important consequences. The legal construction would be the same if the word  connecting  had been used instead of  at-' taching.  The patentee cannot surely claim as his invention the towing of one boat after another. But the manner of attaching the two together would seem to be the right he asks to have secured to him. If he has discovered -any important improvement in this respect, it should have been described in the specification with more certainty and precision. To say that the two boats must be so attached els to be kept always at convenient distance, does not seem to be that full explanation which, after the expiration of the patent, would leave the public much wiser than they were before. What is a convenient distance,  and the particular manner of attaching the one to the other, will still have to be ascertained by experience. If, according to the patent, .the invention claimed is an improvement in the steam tow-boat, the specification, to be complete, should describe the one previously in use, that it might be seen clearly in what the improvement consisted, as the patent cannot cover more than the improvement claimed. These are some of the objections to the patent itself, which present such strong doubts in the mind of the court, as to its validity, that it is deemed improper to interpose an injunction until the validity of the patent has been tried at law. Nor has there been such a possession and enjoyment of any right claimed under the patent, as to induce the court to grant the injunction on that ground. The bill contains no direct allegation that the invention has, at any time, been carried into practical operation by the patentee, or any other persons under his authority. The exertions and' attempts stated to have been made for this purpose are unimportant, unless attended with success. The several acts of state legislatures alleged to have been obtained, do not show any practical use of the invention, nor can they, with propriety, be considered as showing possession of the right claimed. The only part of the bill which affords an inference that the patentee has carried his invention into practice, is that which states, that a company has been formed in Georgia to navigate the river Savannah with steam tow-boats  that they have paid him five thousand dollars for his patent right, and that the success of the company was so great as to induce the formation of other companies in other states. It is perhaps reasonable to infer, that it was intended here to state, that the success which the company met with consisted in profitably navigating the Savannah river with steam tow-boats. But, admitting this to be the inference, there is no time stated when it was put in operation. And the practical use of the invention may be too recent and questionable to call for the protecting power of an injunction. In the case of Hill and Thompson, when Lord Eldon adopted the rule before referred to on this subject, the patentee had had his patent right in operation for about eighteen months  yet this was considered too short a period to justify a continuance of the injunction. We are accordingly of opinion that the motion must be denied. attorneys:  H. D. Sedgwick and II. Sedgwick, for complainant.    C. D. Oolden and S. P.

Patents   Pleading Injunction   Impuovement  Specifications Tow-Boat. 1. On an application for an injunction to restrain the infringement of a patent right, it should be stated in the bill, or by affidavit, that the complainant is the inventor  and the bill must be sworn to. It is not sufficient that he swore to this fact when he obtained his patent. [Cited in Young v. Lippman, Case No. 18,-160: Consolidated Brake-Shoe Co. v. Detroit Steel & Spring Co., 47 Fed. 895.] 2. To obtain the injunction, the case should be such as to leave little if any doubt in the minds of the court, as to the validity of the patent  especially if it rests upon the complainant s own showing without any opposing testimony. [Cited ir. Thomas v. Weeks, Case No. 13.914  Wirt v. Hicks, 46 Fed. 71.] 3. The act of the '15th of February, 1819 [3 Stat. 481], does not alter the principles on which injunctions are granted, but merely extends the jurisdiction of the circuit courts to parties not before falling within it. [Cited in Cochrane v. Deener. 94 U. S. 782  Root v. Lake Shore & M. S. Ry. Co., 105 U. S. 192.] 4. The established rules which govern courts of equity, on such applications are, that where there has been an exclusive possession of some duration, under the patent, an injunction will be granted without putting the party previously to establish the validity of his patent at law. But where the patent is recent, and it is attempted to be shown that the specification is bad. or otherwise that the patent ought not to have been granted, the court will not take the decision upon itself, but will send the party to establish his patent at law. 5. A patent for an improvement should describe the machine in use. that it may be known in what the improvement consists. [Cited in Whitney v. Emmett, Case No. 17,-585.] 6. One had patented,  a new and useful improvement in the steam tow-boat,  but the specification did not mention the invention as an improvement, but simply described a towboat: Bold, that the specification was broader than the patent, and therefore bad. [Cited in Hogg v. Emerson, 6 How. (47 U. S.) 483.] 7. The invention should be so clearly described, as to enable the public to put it in use. [Cited in Hogg v. Emerson, 6 How. (47 U. S.  484.] 8. The specification described the invention as  consisting essentially in attaching the packet to the steam-boat, with ropes, chains, or spars, so as to communicate the power of the engine from the towing vessel to the vessel taken in tow, and kept always at convenient distance, the manner of applying the power, varying with the circumstances in some measure:  Mold bad for uncertainty, and as describing a well known natural power, and not an invention. [Cited in Hovey v. Stevens, Case No. 6.745  Webster Loom Co. v. Higgins. Id. 17.342.] This was an application for an injunction against the violation of a patent right. The complainant stated in his bill, that having ascertained by a course of experiments, that the resistance of the water against the bow or head of a vessel, when moving, is greatly diminished by keeping her as close in the wake after another vessel as possible with convenience, and perceiving the result to be favourable to a new and useful application of steam to the conveying of passengers in a separate boat from the engine, he, on the 4th of December, 1816, obtained a patent  for a new and useful' improvement in the steam tow-boat,  the specification of which was as follows:  I claim as my invention, the application of steam engine power, placed in one vessel to the towing or drawing after her another vessel, for the purpose of conveying thereon passengers or merchandise, or either of them, being a new application of a known power. The manner in which this application may be made, varies with the circumstances in some measure, but essentially consists in attaching the packet to the steamboat, with ropes, chains, or spars, so as to communicate the power of the engine from the towing vessels to vessels taken in tow, and kept always at convenient distance. The advantages attending this improvement are, that lighter and less expensive vessels may be used  he steam engine-boat may be of a. smaller size  and the engine may rest on a frame bearing on her whole extent, but constructed separately from the boat  that any kind of steam engine may be used and applied, especially those of high pressure and lighter construction, without exposing the passengers and merchandise to danger  and there will be more comfort, quiet, and safety in the packet-boat  and it is obvious there may be by means of two or more boats, a convenient separation of the passengers, paying different prices. John L. Sullivan.  The bill further stated, that the complainant en-deavoured to introduce his invention into use as soon as possible, by putting it into practice and otherwise deriving a revenue therefrom  and particularly , that on his proposal a company was formed and incorporated in the state of Georgia, to navigate the river Savannah with steam tow-boats, to whom a prolongation of the time of the patent or exclusive privilege for such navigation, was granted by the state of South Carolina, and that the company purchased complainant s patent-right, paying him 5.000 dollars  that the success of the company was so great as to induce the formation of other companies in other states  that the state of Massachusetts granted him an extension of his term to encourage the introduction of tow-boats on Connecticut river  and that he continued his experiments on Merrimack and Charles rivers. for the purpose of improving in the art. The bill further stated, that the exclusive privilege of Livingston and Fulton had prevented the complainant from introducing his invention in this state, which he had ever been desirous -of doing, until the late decision of the supreme court, declaring those privileges unconstitutional  such a decision as complainant had spent much time and money in endeavouring to procure, but without success. That as soon as possible after this decision, he tried to introduce his invention into New-York, by offering it for sale, and endeavouring to form companies, and by publications in the newspapers. The bill then charged, that the defendants [Redfield and Seymour] and others had associated for the purpose of building and running the steam tow-boat Commerce and safety barge Lady Clinton, for the express purpose of separating the passengers from the boat carrying the engine, in the mode devised by complainant, and for which he had an exclusive right  and that those boats had in June last, been put in use between New-York and Albany, under tlie command of the defendant Seymour, who had thus usurped complainant s privilege, intercepting and preventing the emoluments thereof, which late disastrous accidents on board of steam-boats on the common plan, had rendered more sure, valuable, and important. The bill concluded with a prayer that the defendants might be restrained by injunction from using said boats. The motion was argued on the matters contained in the bill only. H. D. Sedgwick and II.

      "### Response:\n",
      "judges:   parties:  Abraham L. Pennock & James Sellers, Plaintiffs in Error vs. Adam Dialogue. opinions:  Mr Justice Siony delivered the opinion of the Court. This is a Writ of error to the circuit court of Pennsylvania. The original action was brought by the plaintiffs in error for an asserted violation of a patent, granted to them on the 6th of July 1818, for a new and useful improvement in the art of making leather tubes or hose, for conveying air, water, and other fluids. The cause was tried upon the general issue, and a verdict was found for the defendant, upon which judgment passed in his favour  and the correctness of that judgment is now in controversy before this court. At the trial, a bill of exceptions was taken to an opinion delivered by thecourt, in the charge to the jury, as follows, viz.  That the law arising upon the case was, that if an inventor makes his discovery public, looks on and permits others freely to use it, without objection or assertion of claim to the invention, of which the public might take notice  he abandons the inchoate right to the exclusive use of the invention, to which a patent would have entitled him had it been applied for before such use.. And, that it makes no difference in the principle, that the article so publicly used, and afterwards patented, was made by a particular individual, who did so by the private permission of the.inventor. And thereupon, did charge the jury, that if the evidence brings the case within the principle which had been stated.-the court were of opinion that the plaintiffs were riot entitled to a verdict.  The record contains, embodied in the bill of exceptions, the whole of the testimony and evidence offered at the trial,, by each party, in support of the issue. It is jery voluminous, and as no exception was taken to its competency, or sufficiency, either generally or for any particular purpose  it is not properly before this Court for consideration, and forms an expensive and unnecessary burthen upon the record. This Court has had occasion in many cases to express its regret, on account of irregular proceedings of this nature. There' was not the slightest necessity of putting any portion of the evidence in this case upon the record, since the opinion of the court delivered to the jury, presented a general principle of law, and the application of the evidence to it was left to the jury. In the argument at the bar, much reliance has been plated upon this evidence, by the counsel- for both parties. ( It has been said on behalf of the defendants in error  that it called for other and explanatory directions from the court, and that the omission of the court to give them in the charge, furnishes a good ground for. a reversal, as it would have furnished in the court below for . a new trial.. But it is no ground of reversal that the court below omitted to give directions to the jury upon any points of law which might arise in the cause,.where it was not requested by either party at the trial. It is sufficient for us that the court has given no erroneous directions. If either party deems any point presented by the evidence to be omitted in the charge, it is competent for such, party to require an opinion, from the court upon that point. If he does not, it is a waiver of it. The court cannot be presumed to do more, in ordinary cases, than to express its opinion upon the questions which the parties themselves have raised at the trial. On the other hand, the counsel for the defendant in error has endeavoured to extract from the same evidence, strong confirmations of th  charge of the court. But, for the reason already suggested, the evidence must be.laid out of the case, and all the reasoning founded on it falls. The. single question then is, whether the charge of the' court was correct in point of lavv. It has not been, and indeed cannot be denied, that an inventor may abandon his invention, and surrender or dedicate it to the public. This inchoate right, thus once gone, cannot afterwards be resumed at his pleasure  for, where gifts are once made to the public in this way,  they become absolute. . Thus, if a man dedicates a way, or other easement to the public, it is supposed to carry with it a permanent right of user: The question which generally arises at trials, is a question of fact, rather than of law  whether the acts or acquiescence of the party furnish in the given case, satisfactory proof of an abandonment or dedication of the invention to the public. But when all the facts are given, there does not seem any reason why the court may not state the legal conclusion deducible from them. In this view of the matter, the only question would be, whether, upon general principles, the facts stated by the court would justify the conclusion. In the case at bar  it is unnecessary-to consider whether the facts stated in the charge of the court would, upon general principles, warrant the conclusion drawn by the court, independently of any statutory provisions  because, we are of opinion, that the proper answer depends upon the true exposition of the act of congress, under which the present patent was obtained. The constitution of the United t tates has declared, that congress shall have power   to promote the progress of science and useful arts, by securing for limited, times,' to authors and inventors, the exclusive fight to their.respective writings and discoveries.  It contemplates, therefore, thal this exclusive right shall exist but for a limited period, and that the period shall be subject to the discretion of congress. The patent act, of the 21st of February, 1793, ch. 11, prescribes the terms and conditions and manner of obtaining patents for inventions  and proof of a strict compliance with them lies at the foundation of the title acquired by the patentee. The first seqtion provides,  that when any person or persons, being a citizen or citizens of the United States, shall allege that he or they have invented any new or useful art, machine, manufacture, or composition of matter, or any new or useful improvement on any art, machine, or composition of matter, not known or used before the application  and shall present a petition to the secretary of state, signifying, a desire of obtaining an exclusive property in the same, and praying that a patent may be granted therefor  it shall and may be lawful for the said secretary of state, to cause letters patent to be made out in the name of the United States, bearing teste by the President of the United States, reciting the.allegations and suggestions of the. said petition, and giving a short description of the said invention or discovery, and thereupon, granting to the said petitioner, &c.for a term not exceeding fourteen years, the full and exclusive right and liberty of making, constructing, using, and vending to others to be used, the said invention or discovery, &c.  The third section provides,   that every inventor, before he can receive a patent, shall swear, or affirm, that he does verily believe that he is the true inventor or discoverer of the art, machine, or improvement for which he solicits a patent.  The sixth section provides that the defendant shall be permitted to give in defence, to any action brought against him for an infringement of the patent, among other things,   that the thing thus secured by patent was not originally discovered by the patentee, but had been in use, or had been described in some publie work, anterior to the supposed discovery of the patentee.  These- are the only material clauses bearing upon the question now before the court  and upon the construction of them, there has been no inconsiderable diversity of opinion entertained among, the profession, in cases heretofore litigated. It is obvious to the careful inquirer, that many of the provisions of our patent act are derived from the principles and practice which have prevailed in the construction of that of England. It is doubtless true, as has been suggested at the bar, that where English statutes, such for instance, as the statute of frauds, and the statute of limitations  have been adopted into our own legislation  the known and settled construction of those statutes by courts of law, has been considered as silently incorporated into the acts, or has been received with- all the weight of authority. Strictjy speaking, that is not the case in respect to the English statute of monopolies  which contains an exception on which the grants of patents for inventions have issued in-that country. The language of that clause of the statute is not, as we shall presently see, identical with ours  but the construction of it adopted by the English courts, and the principles and practice which have long regulated the grants of their patents, as they must have been known and are tacitly, referred to in some of the provisions of our own statute, afford materials to illustrate it. , By the very terms of the first section of our statute, the v secretary of state is authorised-to grant a patent to any citizen applying for the same, who shall allege that he has invented a new and useful art, machine,, &c. &,c.   not known or used before the application?  The authority is a limited one,, and the party must bring himself within the. terms,, before he can derive any title to demand, or to hold a patent. ..What then is the true meaning of the words   not known or used before the application V They cannot mean that the thing invented was not known or used before the application bythe inventor himself, for' that would be to prohibit him from the only means of obtaining a patent. The use, as well as the knowledge of his invention, must be indispensable to enable him to ascertain its competency to the end proposed, as well as to perfect its component parts. The words then, to have any rational interpretation, must mean, not known or used by others, before the application. But how known or used1? If it were necessary, as it well might be, to employ others to assist in the original structure or use by the inventor himself  or if before his application for a patent his invention should be pirated by another, or used without his consent  it can scarcely be supposed, that the legislature had within its contemplation such knowledge or .use. We think, then, the true meaning must be, not known or used by the public, before the application. And, thus construed, there is much reason for the limitation thus imposed by the act. While one great object was, by holding out a reasonable reward to inventors, and giving them an exclusive right to their inventions for a limited period, to stimulate the efforts of genius    the main object was  to promote the progress of science and useful arts   and this could be done best, by giving the public at large a right to make, construct, use, and vend the thing invented, at as early a period as possible  having a due regard to the rights of the inventor. If an inventor should be permitted to hold back from the knowledge of the public the secrets of his invention  if he should for a long period of years retain the monopoly, and make, and sell his invention publicly, and thus gather the whole profits of it, relying upon his superior skill and knowledge of the structure  and then, and then only, when the danger of competition should force him to secure the exclusive right, he should be allowed to take out a patent, and thus exclude the public from any farther use than what should be derived under jt during his fourteen years  it would materially retard the progress of science and the useful arts, and give' a premium to those who should be least prompt to communicate their discoveries. A provision, therefore, that should withhold from an inventor the privilege of an exclusive right, unless he should, as early as he.should adovv the public use, put the public in possession of his secret, and commence the running of the period, that should limit that right  would not be deemed unreasonable . It might be expected to find a place in a wise prospective legislation on such a subject. If it was already found in the jurisprudence of the mother country, and had not been considered inconvenient there  it would not be unnatural that it should find a place in our own. Now, in point of fact, the statute of 21 Jac. ch. 3,- commonly called the statute of monopolies, does contain exactly such a provision. That act, after prohibiting monopolies generally, contains, in the sixth section, an exception in favour of   letters patent and grants of privileges for fourteen years or undery of the sole working or making of any manner of new manufactures within this realm, to the true and first inventor and-inventors of such manufactures, which others, at the time of making such letters patent and grants, shall not use.  ' Lord Coke, in his commentary upon this clause or proviso, (3 Inst. 184,) says that the letters patent   must be of such manufactures, which any other at the time of making such letters patent did not use  for albeit it were newly invented, yet if any other did use it at the making of the letters patent, or grant of the privilege, it is declared and enacted to be void by this act.  The use here referred to has always been understood to be a public use, and not a private or surreptitious use in fraud of the inventor. In the c'ase of Wood vs. Zimmer, 1 Holt's N. P. Rep. 58, this doctrine was fully recognised by lord chief justice Gibbs. There the inventor had suffered the 'hing invented to be sold, and go into public use for four months before the grant of his patent  and it was held by the court, that on this account the patent was utterly void. Lord chief justice Gibbs said,   To entitle a man to a patent, the invention must be new to the world. The public sale of that which is afterwards made the subject of a patent, though sold by the inventor only, makes the patent void.  By   invention,  the learned judge undoubtedly meant, as .the context abundantly show's, not the abstract discovery, but the thing invented  not the new secret principle, but the manufacture' resulting from it. The words of our statute are not identical with those of the statute of James, but it can scarcely admit of doubt, that they must have been within the contemplation of those by whom it was framed, as well as the construction which had been put upon them by Lord Coke. But if, there were no such illustrative comment, it is difficult to conceive how any other interpretation could fairly be put upon these words. We are not at liberty to reject words which are sensible in the place where they occur, merely because they may be thought, in some cases, to import a hardship, or tie up beneficial rights within very close limits. If an invention is used by the. public, with the consent .of the inventor, at the time of his application for a patent  how can the court say, that his case is, nevertheless, such as the act was intended to protect? If such a public use is not a use within the meaning of the statute, what other use is?. If it be a use within the meaning of the statute, how can the court extract the case from its operation, and support a patent, where the suggestions of the patentee are not true, and the conditions on which alone the grant was authorised to be made, do not exist? In such a case, if the court could perceive no reason for'the restrictions,' the will of the legislature must still be obeyed. It cannot and ought not to be disregarded, where it plainly applies to the case. But if the restriction may be perceived to have a foundation in sound policy, and be an effectual means of accomplishing the legislative objects,' by bringing inventions early into public and unrestricted'use  and above all, if such policy has been avowed- and acted upon in like cases in laws having similar objects  there is very urgent reason to suppose, that tlie act in those terms embodies the real legislative intent, and ought to receive that construction. It is not wholly insignificant in this point of view, that the first patent act passed by congress on this subject, (act of 1790, ch. 34, [ch. 7.) which the present act repeals, uses the words   not known or used before,  without adding the words   the applicati nand in connexion with the structure of the sentence in which they stand, might have been referred either to the time of the invention, or of the application. The addition of the latter words in the patent act of 1793, must, therefore, have been introduced, ex industria, and with the cautious intention to clear away a doubt, and fix the original and deliberate meaning of the legislature. The act of the 17th of April 1800, ch. 25, which extends the privileges of the act of 1793 to inventors whcTare aliens  contains a proviso declaring,   that every patent which shall be obtained, pursuant to the act for any invention, art or discovery, which it shall afterwards appear had been known or used previous to such application for a patent, shall be void.  This proviso certainly certifies the construction of the act of 1793, already asserted'  for there is not any reason. to suppose, that the legislature intended to confer on aliens, privileges, essentially different from those belonging to citizens. On the contrary, the enacting clause of the act of 1800 purports to put both on the same footing  and the proviso seems added as a- gloss or explanation of the original act. The only real doubt which has arisen upon this exposition of the statute, has been created by the words of the sixth section already quoted. That section admits the party sued to give in his defence as a bar, that   the thing thus secured by patent was not originally, discovered by the patentee, but had been in use anterior to the supposed discovery of the patentee.  It has been asked,' if the legislature intended to bar the party vfrom a patent in consequence of a mere prior use, although he was the inventor  why were not the words   anterior to the application  substituted, instead of  ^anterior to the supposed discovery? If a mere use'-of the thing invented before the application were sufficient to bar the right, then, although the party may have been the-first and true inventor, if another person, either innocently as a second inventor, or piratically, were to use it without the knowledge of the first inventor  his right would be gone. In respect to a use by piracy, it is not clear that, any such fraudulent use is within the intent of the statute  and upon general principles it might well be held excluded. In respect to the case of a second invention, it is questionable at least, whether, if by such second invention a public use was already acquired, it could be deemed a case within the protection of the act. If the public were already in possession and c.ommon use of an Invention fairly and without fraud, there might be sound reason for presuming, that the legislature did not intend to grant an exclusive right- to any one to monopolize that which was already common. There would be no quid pro quo   no price for the exclusive right or monopoly conferred upon the inventor for fourteen years. Be this as it may, it is certain that the sixth section is not necessarily repugn nt to'-the construction which the words of the first section require and justify. The sixth section . certainly does not enumerate all the defences which a party may makgdn a suit brought against him for-violating a patent. One obvious omission is, where he uses if under a license or grant from the inventor. The sixth section in the clause under consideration, may well be deemed merely affirmative of what would be the. result from the general principles of law applicable .to other parts of the statute. It gives the right to the first and true inventor and to him only  if known of used before his supposed discovery He is not the first, although' he may be a true inventor  and that i is the case, to which the clause lobks. Rut-it is not inconsistent with this Hncrrine._t.hat although he is the first, as  -welbas-tbgf7TgemventdrTyet4f-lie~?lraIl--ptHH:t-fflto--pubi-ieuse,-- or spfl il_for-publtc-nsrrbefbre*iie applies for a patent., thai-   this .should--fcrnTsh   another bar to his claim. . In this view an interpretation is given to every clause of the statute without. introducing any inconsistency, or interfering with the  ordinary meaning of its language. No public policy is overlooked  and no injury can Ordinarily occur to the first inventor, which is not in some sort the result of fits own laches or voluntary inaction. It is admitted that .the subject is not wholly free from difficulties  but upon most deliberate consideration we are all of opinion, that the true construction of the act is, that the first inventor cannot acquire a good title to a patent: if he suiters-the thing invented to go into-nnhfir use, p blicly sold for use, before he makes application for a pa-~T nt. HTs voluntary act or acquiescence in the public sale and use is an abandonment of .his right  or rather Creates a disability to. comply with the terms and conditions on which alone the secretary of state is authorized to grant him a* patent. The opinion.of the circuit court was therefore perfectly correct  and the judgm nt.is affirmed with costs. This cause came.-on to be heard .on the transcript of the 'record from the circuit court of the United States for the district of Pennsylvania, and was argp 1 by counsel  on. consideration whereof, it is the opinion of this Court, that there is no error in the judgment of the said circuit court. . Whereupon, it is considered, ordered and adjudged by this Court, that , the said judgment of the said circuit court in this caus , be. and the sa ne is hereby affirmed with costs. attorneys:  Mr Webster,, for the plaintiff in error,    Mr Sergeant, for the defendant, corrections:  head_matter: Abraham L. Pennock & James Sellers, Plaintiffs in Error vs. Adam Dialogue. The record contains, embodied in the bill of exceptions, the whole of the testimony and evidence offered at the trial of the, cause by each party in support of the issue. It is very voluminous, and as no exception was taken to its competency or sufficiency, either generally or for any particular purpose  it is not properly before this court ,for consideration, and forms an expensive and unnecessary burthen upon the record. This Court has had occasion, in many cases, to express its regret on account of irregular proceedings of this nature. There was not the slightest necessity of putting any portion of the evidence in this case upon the record  since the opinion of the court, delivered to the jury, presented a general principle of law  and the application of the evidence to it was left to the jury. [15] It is no ground of reversal, that the court below omitted to give directions to the jury upon any points of law which might arise in'the cause, Where it was not requested by either party at the trial. It is sufficient for us, that the court has given no erroneous directions. [16] If either party considers any poipt presented by the evidence, omitted in the charge of the court, it is competent for such party to require an opinion from the court upon that point. The court cannot be presumed to do more In ordinary cases, than to express its opinion upon questions, which the parties themselves have raised on the trial. [16] It has not been, atad indeed it cannot be denied, that an inventor may abandon his invention, and surrender or dedicate it to the.public. This inchoate right, thus gone, cannot afterwards be resumed.at his pleasure  for when gifts are once made to the public in this way, they become absolute. The question which generally arises on trials is a question of fact, rather than of law  whether the acts or acquiescence of the party, furnish, in the given case, satisfactory proof of an abandonment, or dedication of the invention to the public. [16] It is obvious, that many of the provisions of our patent act, are derived from the principles and practice which have prevailed in the construction of the law of . England in relation to patents. [18] Where English statutes, such for instance as the statute of frauds, and the statute of limitations, have been adopted into our own legislation  the known and settled construction of those statutes by courts of law, has been considered as silently incorporated into the acts  or has been received with all the weight of authority. This is not the case with the English statute of monopolies, which contains aq exception, on which the grants of patents for inventions have issued in that country.' The language of that clause in the statute is not identical with the patent law of the United States  but the construction of it adopted by the English courts, and the'principles and practice which have long .regulated, the grants of their patents  as they must have been known, and are tacitly referred to in some of the provisions of our own statute, afford materials to illustrate it. [18] The true meaning of the words of the patent law,   not known or used before the application   is, not known or used by the public, before the application. [19] If an inventor should he permitted to hold back from the knowledge of the public the secrets of his invention  if he should, for a long period of years,- retain the monopoly, and make and sell his invention publicly  and thus gather the whole profits of it, relying upon his superior skill and knowledge of the structure  and then, and then only, when the danger of competition should force him to procure the exclusive right, he should be allowed to take out a patent, and thus exclude the public from any further use, than what Should be derived undSrit, duriffg hTs fddrfeen'years  it wouSTThateriaily retard the progress of science and the useful .arts   and give a premium to those who' should be least prompt to communicate their discoveries. [19] If an invention is used by the public, with the cpnsent of the inventor, at the time of' his application for a patent  how can the Court say, that his case is nevertheless such as the. act was intended to protect ? If such a public use is not a use.within the meaning of the statute  how can the Court extract the case from its operation, and support a patent, when the suggestions of the patentee were not true   and the conditions, on which alone the grant was authorised, do not exist ? [21] The true construction of tire patent law is, that the first inventor cannot acquire a good title to a patent, if he suffers the thing invented to go into public use, or to be publicly sold for use, before he makes application for a patent. This voluntary act, or acquiescence in the public sale or use, is an abandonment of his right  or rather, creates   disability to comply with the terms and conditions of the law  on which alone the'secretary-of state is authorised to-grant him a patent. [23] THIS case was brought before the Court, on a writ of error to the circuit court for the eastern district of Pennsylvania. In that court,' the plaintiffs in eryor had instituted their suit against the defendants, for an infringement of a patent right, for   an improvement in tber^aft ot making tubes or hose for conveying air, water, and other fluids.  . The invention claimed by the patentees, was in the mode of making the hose so that the parts so joined together would be tight, and as capable of resisting the pressure as any other part of the machine. TJhe bill, of exceptions, which came up with the record, contained the whole evidence given in the trial of the cause   in the circuit court. The invention, for which the' patent right was claimed, was completed in 1811  and the'letters patent were obtained in 1818, In this interval, upwards of thirteen thousand feet of h se,. constructed according to the invention of the patentees, had been made and sold in. the city Of Philadelphia. One, Samuel Jenkins, by the permission of, arid under an agreement between the plaintiffs as to the price  had made and' sold jtbe hose invented by the plaintiffs, and supplied several hose companies in the city of Philadelphia with the same. Jenkins, during much of the time, wasin the service of the plaintiffs, and J  T beeri-^instructed by~them in the art' of making the hose.. There was no positive evidence, that the agreement between Jenkins and the plaintiffs in error was known to,, or concealed from the public. The plaintiffs,-on the trial, did not allege or offer evidence to prove that they had delayed making, application for a patept, for the purpose of improvingjbeir invention  or that from 1811 to 1818, any important modifications or alterations had been made in their riveted hose. The plaintiffs claimed before the jury, that all the hose which h adheep ma.dft_a.nfl sold to-the public,, prior to their  patent7~had been-feonstr Rted-afid,vended by Jenkins Under- ~~ their permission     Upon the whole evidence in. the case, th  circuit court charged the jury:  We are clearly of opinion that if an inventor makes his discovery public,' looks on and permits others freely to use it, without objection or. assertion of claim to. the invention, of which the public might take notice.  he abandons the inchoate right to the exclusive use of the invention, to which a patent would have entitled him, had it beqn applied for.before such use. And we think it makes no difference in the principle, that the article so publicly used, and afterwards patented, .was made by a particular individual, who did so by the private permission of the inventor. As long as an inventor keeps to himself the subject of his discovery, the public cannot be injured: and even if. it be made public, but accompanied by. an assertion of the inventor s claim to the discovery, those who should make or use the subject of the invention would at least be put upon their guard. But if the public, with the knowledge and the tacit consent of the inventor, is permitted to use   the invention without opposition, it is a fraud upon the public afterwards to take out a patent. It is possible that the inventor may not have intended to give the benefit of his discovery to the public  and may have supposed that by giving permission to a particular individual to construct for others the thing patented, he could not be presumed to have done so. But it is not a question of intention, which is involved in the principle which we have laid down  but of legal inference, resulting from the conduct of the inventor, and affecting the interests of the public. It is for the jury to say, whether the evidence brings this case within the principle which has been stated. If it does, the court is of opinion that the- plaintiffs are not entitled -to a Verdict.  To this charge the plaintiffs excepted, and the jury gave a verdict for the defendant. Mr Webster,, for the plaintiff in error, contended, 1. That the invention, being of such a nature that the use of it, for the purpose of trying its utility and bringing it to perfection, must necessarily be open and public  the implication of a waiver or abandonment of. the right, fur- . nished by such public use, is rebutted by the circumstance that the article was made and sold only by one individual  an,d that individual was authorized and permitted so to do . by the inventors., 2. That the use of an invention, however public, if it be . by the permission and under the continual exclusive claim of the inventor  does not take away his right, except after an. unreasonable lapse of time, or gross negligence, in applying for a patent. 3. That the jury should have been instructed, that, if they found the riveted hose, which was in use by the hose companies, had been all made and sold by Jenkins, and by nb one else, pnot to the grant of the patent  and that he was permitted by the inventors, .under their agreement, so to make and sell the same , that such use of the invention, not being adverse to. their claim, did not take away their exclusive right,. nor imply an abandonment of it to the public, . 4. That, if th y found the hose had not been made or sold, prior to the grant of the patent,. by any person but Jenkins,, then the giving of permission to him, being in it-, self aii assertion of claim, was nbt^ a dedication to the public  and that the piiblic, by purchasing and using the hose, thus made by the permission of the inventors, acquired  no title to the invention^-b t, on the contrary,' if the price paid included a premiuin for the invention,, the public by so purchasing, admitted the right of'the inventors. 5. That, at any rate, there being no us , by the public, of this invention, iit should have b en left to the jury, to say, whether, tinder all the circumstances, considering the nature of the invention, and the time necessary to perfect it  the plaintiffs h ve. been guilty, of negligence, in not sooner applying for a patent .' '   ' Mr Webster stated, that the question to be decided by the Court laid within a.narrow compass. The defence, set up was, that the plaintiffs had suffered their, invention to be used before their application for a patent  and had thus lost all right to the exclusive us  of it. The Court, in this case, would be called upon to reverse the English decision relativ  to abandonments  for it wa > admitted, that those cases had gone to the whole extent of the principles applied to this Case in the circuit court. Those cases have decided, that any public use of an invention, even for experiment, renders it no longer a new machine. In the courts of the United States, a more just view had been talcen of the rights of inventors. The laws of the Uriited States were intended to protect, those rights, and to confer benefits  while the provisions hi the statute of England, under which patents are issued, are'exceptions to the law prohibiting monopolies. Hence, the construction of the British statute had been exceedingly straight and narrow, and different from the more liberal interpretation of our laws. By the decisions of  ur courts, there must be a voluntary abandonment, or negligence, or unreasonable delay in obtaining letters patent, to destroy the right of the patentee. Goodyear vs. Mathews, Paine's Rep. 300  Morris vs. Huntington, Id. 348,. The exception to the charge of the court is  that the jury should have been instructed to decide upon the evidence, whether the plaintiff meant to abandon his invention by the permission to Jenkins to use it. Jenkins must be considered as the private agent of the inventors  artd their agreement with him, under which. he made the hose, is to be considered rather as an assertion of their exclusive right to the invention, than a surrender of it. By omitting to leave to the jury this question of an intention to abandon, the case was erroneously withdrawn from' them. The rights of the parties also entitled them to have the causes of their delay in patenting their invention inquired of by the jury. As the case is presented on the bill of exceptions, the court in their charge undertook to state the whole law of the subject matter' to the jury  and the omission to instruct them on any one point is error. If in this charge of the court any thing is omitted which was matter of law for the jury, it is. misdirection. In a case in Massachusetts, said to be reported in 4th Mason s Rep., it was left- to the jury to decide whether seventeen years  delay could be accounted for. Under the provisions of the laws  of the United States, the right is created by the invention, and not by the patent. The court, therefore, may have misled the jury, iii stating that the plaintiffs allowed the invention to be used. The thing invented was only permitted to be used. The suggestion, that by adopting the language of the English statute, the cases decided in England upon that statute are adopted, may be answered ,by a reference to those cases. They have all arisen within a few years, since the enactment of our law  and, except the dictum of Lord Coke in 2d Institute, the authorities are all of modern date. If this Court shall be of opinion, that as no instructions were particularly asked upon the questions raised here, the court below were not. bound to notice them in the charge,, and that the court did not undertake to decide the whole law  the plaintiff in error can make out no case here. But if this Court shall consider the questions now submitted doubtful, as the rights''of the plaintiffs may not have been fully investigated j by sending the case back to the circuit court, a more full investigation of all the. points involved in it may be made.- Mr Sergeant, for the defendant, insisted, 1. That mere invention gives no right to an exclusive use, unless a patent is obtained  and that if at a time when no right is infringed, the public fairly acquire possession of it, the inventor cannot, by subsequently obtaining a patent, take it away. 2. That the inventor, by abstaining from getting a patent encouraged the public to use the article freely, and thus   benefited his own manufactory. And he is not at liberty, vyhen this advantage is exhausted, to turn round, and en-deavour to reach another and a different kind of advantage, by appropriating the use exclusively to himself.   In the circuit where this cause was- tried,. ,it was not the practice to ask the court for special instructions, to the jury. After the evidence had been closed, and counsel heard,- a charge was given to the jury, according to the nature of the case, upon the points made by counsel, .or .which . might suggest themselves to the mind of the judge. It was competent, however, to either party, after the charge, to ask the opinion of the court upon any point supposed to have been omitted, which was material to the decision. In this case, no such request had been made  and no objection can now be made to the charge, for any imputed omission. The only question was, whether the principles   laid down to the jury for. their guidance were.correct, and'according to law, in the particular excepted to.. The charge must of course be considered with reference to the facts, the whole of which appear, upon the record. The petition of the plaintiffs to the secretary of state stated,. in the words of the patent law, that they were the inventors-of a  n vv and useful improvement,    not .known or used before their application.  The   application  was made, in July 1818. Their averment therefore, upon which they obtained' their patent was, that the  rivet hose was >a new invention, not   known or used  before the year 1818.' The facts proved upon the trial were, that the invention had been completed and published in the year 1811, s.even years before the application. That during all that period, it. had been known and used  s common public property, (and not as private property) which any one might use.as piihlicly' known. And that it was so known and used, with the know- . ledge of those who now claim to be the inventors  without . any assertion or claim op their part of exclusive, property, and without notice df intention to make'such claim. There was not a single circumstance offered, to explain the delay. Ther  was an attempt to show, that tK  making ,of the article for use, was limited by the authority and permission of the plaintiffs, and thence to infer that they did not intend to give it to the public, .A witness, produced by them, and the only person who appeared to have made the article, declared in substance,   that he was taught by the plaintiffs in 1811 to make hose  that in that year he made a certain quantity of-it for the Philadelphia Hose Company, plaintiffs being members of the committee  and that by permission of the plaintiffs he made about thirteen thousand feet of hose, for different hose companies, from 1811 to the time of granting the patent.  Thus, in point of fact, nearly two miles and a half in length of hose, had been made at different times in the course of seven years before the patent  and had been sold to different hose companies  not to experime'nt with, in order to bring the invention to perfection  but for public use, as a thing already completed, and adapted to the purpose of arresting the ravages of fire. It was so used  and from the year 1811 to the year 1818, it was never materially altered or improved. The thing patented in 1818 was precisely the thing invented, completed and used in 1811. Were the plaintiffs, under these circumstances,, entitled to a patent1? or could a patent, thus obtained, be supported1? The authorities upon the subject are decisive. He did not admit that the weight of judicial or legal opinion in England was lessened by the supposed difference in the policy of the two countries, or that in fact any such difference existed. . It was true, that the process or mode of legislation w.as varied according to the existing state of things. The statute of James was made to abolish monopolies  but it saved, by exception, the rights of the inventors of new and useful inventions, who had before enjoyed exclusive privileges. The constitution of the United States and the act of congress  on the ' ^ntrary, having no monopolies to deal with  created exclusive privileges in favour of the same description of persons. The one preserved to them a pre-existing monopoly, and the other conferred it upon them. Both were influenced by the merits of the inventor, and the public advantage of encouraging inventive genius. And they were equally influenced by these considerations  for it required at least as strong a sense of'their just claims to distinction, to except new and useful inventions from the statutory odium and denunciation, of monopolies, as it did to confer upon them the Benefits of monopoly by direct enactment. There was no r ason, therefore, why the judicial construction of the statute of James,. (from which our act of congress was in this respect copied,) which had become, as it were, incorporated with, and part of the statutej should not be as much respected as in the instance of any other statute. The adoption of the language of the statute, was the adoption also of its settled interpretation. It could.not surely be insisted that England was wanting in intelligence to discern the value of genius, or in liberality to reward it  or that there was a prevailing bias in her judiciary, towards an unjust restriction of the rights of meritorious inventors. The sentiment of the nation, and the government, in all its .branches, was the opposite Qf this. Before referring to the cases, it might be. well,, however, to examine the matter a little upon principle. What is the right of an inventor1? It is the right, given to him by the law, to apply for and obtain a patent for his invention. The patent, when duly obtained, secures to him the exclusive enjoyment. Has he any other right before he obtains a patent than the one just stated1? It is obvious that he has not. This, then, is what the learned judge, in his charge, styles, with peculiar aptness, an inchoate right  that is, a right to have a title upon complying with the terms and conditions of the law: It is like an inchoate right to land, or an inceptive right to land, well known in some of the states, and every where accompanied with the condition, that to be made available, it must be prosecuted with due diligence, io the consummation or completion of the title. If .the condition be not complied with, the right is abandoned or-lost, and the rights of others are let in. The . abandonment is not a question of intention of the.party, but it is the legal construction of his acts or omissions. Had the plaintiffs ever such an inchoate right1? According to the opinion of the judge, they undoubtedly had such a right by their invention in 1811. Then, they could have made out the case required by the first section of the act of congress   they could have stated with truth, that the thing invented   was not known or used before their application.  But in the year 1818 it was no longer true. It might be stated, .but it could not be truly stated. They were, unable to comply with the condition-of law. For, if the inventor, as was the case here, voluntarily permit his invention to be known and used, as a thing hot intended to be patented, how can he make this statement1? By so doing, he abandons his inchoate right, he proclaims to the world that he does not mean to secure it by patent, and every one is at liberty to consider it abandoned  because every ope acquainted with the law knows that he has incurred a disability. This is the inevitable legal construction of his conduct, and is altogether independent.of his intention fun-less we suppose the act to be guilty of the absurdity of requiring that to be stated which it does not require to be true. But the terms-of the act are in this respect too plain to admit of a doubt. Suppose an applicant should state, that his invention had been known and used for seven years before his application, could, he obtain a patent? Suppose he.should state, that he had always intended to reserve to himself a right to obtain a patent, would that help him? Or, if he should state that it had been so known and used, osly-by his permission? The language of the act is plaih and imperative. There is no'scope for interpretation. The prescribed conditionds express. And there is no doubt th t it was the intention of congress to refer to the   application,  as the period before which the-thing was not known or used  for in the subsequent act of 17-th April .1800, conferring the privileges of the patent law upon resident, aliens, the same word is used for the same purpose'. And it is- declared that the patent shall be void if the thing patented was known or used before the application. Act of 17th April  800, section!. It is not contended, that if the invention should be pirated, the use or knowledge, obtained by the piracy, or otherwise obtained without the knowledge or consent and without the fault of the inventor  would bar him from getting a patent. Nor is it contended that his own knowledge and use would be a bar. The latter is a necessary exception out of the generality of the terms of the law, because every inventor must know his invention, and must use it to the extent of ascertaining its usefulness, before he applies for a patent. The former is a case where there is no fault on the part of the inventor. . But it is contended, that the inventor who means to rely upon a patent must make his application within a reasonable time  and that if he permit his invention to be publicly known and used before he applies, he cannot obtain a patent. He abandons his right, if he sell it for public use himself, and a fortiori, if he permit another so to sell it. There is a cautious intimation in the charge, that possibly there might be some saving efficacy in accompanying the use with an assertion of claim by the inventor. And it is also put as a circumstance against the plaintiffs (which was clearly in e.vid n'ce) that there was no such assertion or notice. The charge is theiefore applicable only to a case of unqualified public use, without notice or assertion of claim. That such a notice would be available, or that there can be any other assertion of claim than the legal assertion by applying for a patent  are propositions which it is not now necessary to examine. They were not affirmatively laid down by the court, nor otherwise adverted u> than for the purpose of showing that the facts did not entitle the plaintiffs to the benefit of them. They cannot therefore complain. Whether such assertions or notice, contradicted by the acts of the inventor, will be available, is a question not decided below. Certain it is, that a secret permission given to their own agent, can no more be an assertion or notice, than a resolution locked up in their own breasts. The construction contended for is in accordance with the policy of the law. Patents are intended to be granted for a limited time, beginning with the invention. He who asks for one must describe his invention with such certainty as will ensure to the public its use, when the patent.expires  and at the expiration of the time, the thing invented is public' property. The inventor, to enjoy its benefits, must place his whole reliance upon it. Is it competent for him,' then, to secure to himself the advantages. of his own peculiar knowledge and skill, as long as these will'avail' him, and when they ar  exhausted, to apply for a patent1? There are many inventions, the secret of which is not at once discoverable from an inspection of the thing invented. The inventor may keep that as long as he can. He may have extraordinary skill or methods of working which will enable him-to keep the market to himself. May he enjoy these exclusive privileges for seven years,  rid then obtain a patent for fourteen more ? He would then have the exclusive us  for twenty-one years. If for seven, why not for fourteen, or twenty-one, or. any other assignable time1? The moment that his invention comes' into the m st common or public use, is the moment when he applies for a patent. When the public have fully got possession of it, he seeks to withdraw it from' the. common stock and appropriate it to himself. This is directly contrary to the design of the l Vv. It extends the term, and inverts the order of proceeding. The inconveniences would be very great.-   Those who - were engag d in making the article must stop. Those who had arranged for making it must abandon their arrangements.   Those, who had- employed their time in learning to make it must los  their time arid their labour. And even a bona fide inventor, who had discovered the same thing by his oWn study and experiments, would be deprived  of the fruits of his ingenuity  ri'd exertions.1 And why ? Simply because, th'  first inventor did not choose sooner to take, out a patent, as he might have done:  The^conditions-of the law b irig such as he can comply with,  and.ought'to comply with   he postpones-a compliance for'his own profit, and leads the-community into an injurious error. ' If it be designed, it is a wrong. Ifit be without design, it is negligence.. Ought he to be benefited by his own wrong or negligence ^ The authorities are against him. He cited 3' Inst. 184   Wood us. Zimmer, 1 Holt s N. P. Rep. 58  Whittemore vs. Cutter,- ! Gall. 482 and . referred to Evans vs. Eaton, 1 Peters s C. C. Rep. 348  Thompson us. Haight, 1 U.S. Lata Journal, 563. He then examined the several points stated for the defendant, contending that some of them were unsupported by t.he facts, and others by the law. Under the second he argued that there had been an  unreasonable lapse of time,  and  gross negligence.  That seven years (the period here) unexplained were beyond all reasonable bounds. He contended, also, that due diligence^ where there were no circumstances of explanation, was a.question of law  and that it consisted in applying for a patent as soon, after the invention was completed, as could reasonably be done: and, finally, that due diligence required that the application should be made before the thing invented was publicly known and used with the consent of the inventor\n",

      "judges:   parties:  PATTON et al. v. REILY. opinions:  M’NAIRY, District Judge. The objections •which apply to the first two modes of proof offered by the plaintiffs have been decided as valid by this court upon a former occasion. At that time I was of opinion that the execution of the deed might be proved upon the trial, and given in evidence before it had been registered. After a very full investigation I am constrained to alter that part of my former decision. Registration was intended by the legislature to stand in the place of livery of seizin. By the common law no estate could pass without livery of seizin; and the same may be said as to its substitute. Lands as conveyed by this deed, would not pass the estate at common law; and if it will pass, it must be by act of assembly. The act of 1715 requires the deed to be registered before a legal estate is vested in the grantee. To create a title under this act of assembly the party claiming the benefit of it must have complied with its requisitions, one of which is that the deed shall be registered. The deed cannot be read in evidence. And the plaintiffs were nonsuited. attorneys:  Dickinson and Cooke, for defendant, corrections:  head_matter: Case No. 10,838. PATTON et al. v. REILY. [1 Brunner, Col. Cas. 180; 4 Cooke, 119.] Circuit Court, D. Tennessee. 1812. Conveyance — Registkation Necessary to Pass-Legal Notice. The legal estate will not pass to the grantee by a deed of conveyance, unless such deed be registered, registration having been substituted by the legislature for livery of seizin. [Cited in Olcott v. Bynum, 17 Wall. (84 U. S.) 58.] The plaintiffs, in support of their title,, produced in evidence a grant from the state of North Carolina to John G. Blount and Thomas Blount, for five thousand acres of land, as mentioned in the declaration; and they offered in evidence a deed from the-grantees to David Allison, under whom they claim. This deed had upon the back of it the following indorsements; “This deed of' bargain and sale from J. G. Blount and Thomas Blount to David Allison was this day proved to be the act and deed of the-grantors by John Blackledge, a subscribing' witness thereto. J. Haywood. J. S. C. L. E.” “Let it be registered. J. Haywood, J. S. C. L. E.” Upon the back of the deed also appeared a probate of the oaths of several witnesses, stating that the two subscribing witnesses were dead; that the persons called upon also were well acquainted with the-handwriting of the subscribing witnesses, and the handwriting of John G. Blount and Thomas Blount; and that the attestation was in the handwriting of the witnesses. They also proved the handwriting of the grantors in the same way. Upon these probates respectively the deed had been registered. The plaintiffs also offered, and produced' witnesses in open coux-t who proved the handwriting of the subscribing witnesses, and that they were dead; and also the handwriting of the grantors, and that one of them, viz., Thomas Blount, was dead, and the other lived in North Carolina. Dickinson and Cooke, for defendant, objected to reading the deed in evidence. A\" to the probate before J. Haywood, there can be no pretense for its legality. A law passed' in 1794, authorizing deeds to be registered in this country, if proved before a judge of a superior court in another state. It is not pretended but that the person who took this probate is not. nor ever was, a judicial officer of this state; and if he were, the probate would still be illegal, because no law ever-authorized proof of the execution of a deed in that manner. To make this probate and the consequent, registration good it must in some way appear that the person receiving' it really acted in the capacity which the law requires. To the end of the name T. Haywood is added the hieroglyphics J. S. C. L. E., which the gentlemen will say mean justice of the superior court of law and equity. It does happen that these characters will correspond with the initials of that title; but they as well stand for almost anything else. It may be the cipher used in North Carolina, designating the title of their judges; but this court cannot officially take notice of it. Besides, if we can give a legal interpretation of these letters, and thereby be enabled to explain them so as to suit the ideas of the plaintiff’s counsel, still there is an essential wanting, because it does not from the certificate appear of what state Mr. Haywood was a judge. There is not even an initial which stands for North Carolina. Although, then, he may be a judge of a superior court of law and equity for anything that appears to the court, it may be in some one of the territories, or even out of the United States. In short, it does not appear that he really occupied the station which the act of assembly required as a prerequisite to his receiving the probate. Now, as to the second objection viz., the proof by parity of hands. It will not be contended on the other side that the deed now produced in evidence would pass any legal estate at common law. By the common law livery of seizin was necessary to be made upon every grant of an estate, whether of inheritance or for life only. 2 Bl. Comm. 318. To remedy the inconvenience which might result from this ceremony in England was passed the statute of Henry VIII., recognizing deeds of bargain and sale; and in this country the act of the North Carolina legislature, making, in substance, a similar provision, passed in 1715. It is entitled “an act to appoint public registers, and to direct the method that shall be observed in conveying lands,” etc., and provides “that no conveyance, or bill of sale for lands (other than mortgage), in what manner of form soever drawn, shall be good and available in law, unless the same shall be acknowledged by the vendor, or proved by one or more evidences upon oath, either before the chief justice for the time being, or in the court of the precinct where the land lieth, and registered by the public register of the precinct where the land lieth, within twelve months from the execution thereof; and that all deeds so done and executed shall be valid, and pass estates in land, or right to other estate, without livery of seizin, attournment, or other ceremony whatsoever.” It will be argued by Mr. Whiteside, that as the legislature, in the act of 1715, required the deed previous to registration to be proved by evidence, it is not necessary to resort to the subscribing witnesses in those cases where proof of handwriting would be sufficient at common law. What would have been the construction of that act upon a deed offered to be proved in one year after the execution (which is not the case here), and before any other statute had passed on the subject, it will not now be necessary to in* quire, as we expect to show that from a uniform train of legislative declarations it has been always required that the deed should either be acknowledged by the grantor, his agent or attorney, or proved by the subscribing witnesses. The next law which passed upon this subject was enacted in 1760, and expressly provides that before the deed can be admitted to registration it shall be acknowledged by the grantor, his agent or attorney or proved by the oath of the subscribing witnesses, and gives two years time for registration. In the act of 1776 will be found a provision in the same words; so also in the acts of 1773, 1777, 1782, and 1784, and in every other law which has passed on. the subject, except the law of 1811, which can be of no service to the plaintiffs, as the probate now objected to was made several years before. As a further evidence of the legislative meaning upon this point, if anything is required more than an express declaration, we will refer the court to an act ■ passed in 1787, providing that the deeds from the office of Lord Grenville might be proved by parity of hands. Now, if this was understood to be the law before in relation to all deeds, it was, to say' the least of it, extremely absurd to say it should apply to a particular kind of deeds; for it would have applied to them without any such law. It is, therefore, a fair mode of argument to say that, when the legislature recognized proof of a certain description as being sufficient to establish the execution of a particular kind of deeds, they meant thereby to exclude the idea of that proof being sufficient to prove the execution of other deeds. As a further illustration of the uniform view which the legislature have taken of this point we will refer the court to two statutes, — the one enacted by North Carolina in 1756 (chapter 6, § 4, Hayw. Rev. 66), and the other by the legislature of Tennessee, in the year 1806 (chapter 49, § 1, Hayw. Rev. 413). Each of these statutes was intended to remedy a particular inconvenience. The grantee had no summary method of compelling the attendance of witnesses to a deed, for the purpose of proving the execution preparatory to registration. This was an evil which the legislature felt anxious to cure, and therefore they passed these statutes, respectively, authorizing the grantee to apply to the court of the county where land might lie, and procure a summons for the subscribing witnesses, compelling them to attend, and testify what they knew about the execution of the deed. The evil was that the grantee had no summary way of compelling the proof of the execution of his deed. (Perhaps the only previous mode was by a bill to perpetuate testimony.) The legislature, to remedy this inconvenience, passed the laws in question, authorizing a process to compel the attendance of the subscribing witnesses. If it had been the law that the execution of the deed could be proved by witnesses other than those who were subscribed as such, this remedy would be but half complete. In truth, it was never believed by the legislature that the deed could be proved by any but the subscribing witnesses, and therefore, when they make a remedial provision on that subject, they only speak of witnesses of that legal character. NOTE. Unregistered deed cannot be read in. evidence of conveyance. See Olcott v. Bynum, 17 Wall. [84 U. S.] 58, citing above case. [For other actions by same plaintiffs against different defendants, see Oases Nos. 10,831-10,S35J The only statute which we shall notice was passed in 1811, subsequent to the respective probates. It provides that where the witnesses are dead, or live out of th'e state, and the grantor is also dead, that the deed may be registered by proving the handwriting of the witnesses and grantor; and then when it is so proved and registered it shall be read in evidence. The plaintiffs do not pretend that they come within the provision of this act, nor can they do so, because their probate and registration Is long prior to the passage of the law, and because the law is only prospective, and is to continue in force for two years thereafter. It seems most manifest that no such privilege existed previous to the enactment of this statute, and that the object of the legislature was to provide a new remedy, which was to be tried for a limited time. But admitting that a deed for land may be proved as an instrument at common law, so as to pass the legal estate to the grantee, and still we must prevail. The evidence offered is ex parte. In those cases at common law where proof of the execution was admitted by persons other than the subscribing witness, it was in open court, and not by an ex parte exam-ination. . ■ As to the. third objection, viz., proof of execution upon trial, we will briefly state what we conceive to be the law. When this testimony is offered it is upon the principle that there has been no registration. We contend that until registration no estate passes. The act of 1715 is the only law of this country which authorizes lands to pass by deed. It is in substance a copy of the statute (27 Hen. VIII.) in relation to deeds of bargain and sale. The English statute requires that the deed shall be enrolled; and our statute requires that It should be registered; and these things must be respectively done before any estate passes. It may be that when registered it relates back to the time of execution; but still until it is registered the legal estate is not in the grantee. It has constantly been determined in England that no estate passes until after enrollment. 1 Bac. Abr. 277, 278; Cro. Jae. 52; Hynde’s Case, 4 Coke, 70a; 2 Com. Dig. 65, 66. Upon this point we know of no determination in this country. A ease occurred in North Carolina in which the court said that when the deed was enrolled, it passed the estate ab initio, and would so operate as to consider the grantee as legally seized from the execution. 2 Hayw. N. C. 287, 288. Such a determination could alone be founded upon the idea that no estate passed without registration. Indeed, the act of assembly expressly requires it preparatory, to the passing a legal estate; and it is not for the court to say it may be passed in any other way. In truth, it will not do for the gentleman to say that the act is to be disregarded, for it is the very foundation of his claim; it has no effect whatever without it. In those cases where an instrument has been supported by discarding a statute made upon the subject, the courts have done so upon the ground that the instrument is good at common law. There is no pretense for such a thing in this case. There never was a case where a right accrued under a statute that such right was adjudged valid if the express requisitions of the statute had not been complied with. Those requisitions have not been complied With in this case; the deed has not been registered; and therefore we humbly hope that it will be rejected. \n",
      "judges:   parties:  PATTON AND ERWIN’S LESSEE v. REILY. opinions:  M’NaiRY, J. The objections which apply to the first two modes of proof offered by the plaintiffs have been decided as valid by this Court upon a former occasion. At that time I was of opinion that the execution of the deed might be proved upon the trial and given in evidence before it had been registered. After a very full investigation, I am constrained to alter that part of my former opinion. Registration was intended by the Legislature to stand in the place of livery of seisin. By the common law no estate could pass without livery of seisin; and the same may be said as to its substitute. Lands as conveyed by this deed would not pass the estate at common law; and if it will pass, it must be by act of Assembly. The Act of 1715 requires the deed to be registered before a legal estate is vested in the grantee. To create a title under this act of Assembly, the party claiming the benefit of it must have complied with its requisitions, one of which is that the deed shall be registered. The deed cannot be read in evidence. And the plaintiffs were nonsuited. attorneys:  Dickinson and Gooke, for the defendant, corrections:  head_matter: Federal Court. Nashville. 1812. PATTON AND ERWIN’S LESSEE v. REILY. >- Ejectment. A deed of conveyance does not pass the legal state to the grantee until it is registered. [ Acc. Stinson v. Russell, 2 Tenn. 40; contra Carter «. Parrot, 1 Tenn. 237, and the law is now well settled in accord with the latter case; Vance v. M’Nairy, 3 Y. 171; 10 Y. 1; 6 Y. 820; 10 Hum. 92, 602.] The plaintiffs, in support of their title, produced in evidence, a grant from the State of North Carolina to John G. Blount and Thomas Blount, for five thousand acres of land, as mentioned in the declaration; and they offered in evidence a deed from the grantees to David Allison, under whom they claim. This deed had upon the back of it the' following indorsements. “ This deed of bargain and sale from J. G. Blount and Thomas Blount to David Allison, was this day proved to be the act and deed of the grantors, by John Blackledge, a subscribing witness thereto. J. Haywood, J. S. C. L. E.” “ Let it be registered. • J. Haywood, J. S. C. L. E.” Upon the back of the deed also appeared a probate of the oaths of several witnesses, stating that the two subscribing witnesses were dead ; that the persons called upon also were well acquainted with the handwriting of the subscribing witnesses, and the handwriting of John G. Blount and Thomas Blount; and that the attestation was in the handwriting of the witnesses. They also proved the handwriting of the grantors in the same way. Upon these probates respectively, the deed had been registered. The 'plaintiffs also offered, and produced witnesses in open court, who proved the handwriting of the subscribing witnesses, and that they were dead; and also the handwriting of the grantors, and that one of them, viz. Thomas Blount, was dead, and the other lived in North Carolina. Dickinson and Gooke, for the defendant, objected to reading the deed in evidence. As to the probate before J. Haywood, there can be no pre-tence for its legality. A law passed in 1794, authorizing deeds to be registered in this country, if proved before a judge of a superior court in another State. It is not pretended but that the person who took this probate, is not, nor ever was, a judicial officer of this State; and if he were, the probate would still be illegal; because no law ever authorized proof of the execution of a deed in that manner. To make this probate and the consequent registration, good, it must in some way appear, that the person receiving it, really acted in the capacity which the law requires. To the end of the name J. Haywood, is added the hieroglyphics, J. S. C. L. E. which the gentlemen will say, mean Justice of the Superior Court of Law and Equity. It does happen that these characters will correspond with the initials of that title ; but they as well stand for almost anything else. It may be the cipher used in North Carolina, designating the title of their judges ; but this Court cannot officially take notice of it. Besides, if we can give a legal interpretation to these letters, and thereby be enabled to explain them, so as to suit the ideas of the plaintiff’s counsel, still there is an essential wanting, because it does not from the certificate appear of what State Mr. Haywood was a judge. There is not even an initial which stands for North Carolina. Although, then, he may be a judge of a superior court of law and equity for anything that appears to the Court, it may be in some one of the Territories, or even out of the United States. In short, it does not appear that he really occupied the station which the act of Assembly required as a prerequisite to his receiving the probate. Now, as to the second objection, viz. the proof by parity of hands. It will not be contended on the other side, that the deed now produced in evidence, would pass any legal estate at common law. By the common law, livery of seisin was necessary to be made upon every grant of an estate, whether of inheritance or for life only. 2 Bla. Com. 318. To remedy the inconvenience, which might result from this ceremony, in England, was passed the statute of Henry' 8, recognizing deeds of bargain and sale ; and in this country, the Act of the North Carolina Legislature, making, in substance, a similar provision, passed in 1715. It is entitled “ an Act to appoint public Registers, and to direct the method that shall be observed in conveying lands,” etc., and provides “ That no conveyance, or bill of sale, for lands (other than mortgage) in what manner of form soever drawn, shall be good and available in law, unless the same shall be acknowledged by the vendor, or proved by one or more evidences, upon oath, either before the chief justice for the time being, or in the Court of the precinct where the land lieth, and registered by the public register of the precinct where the land lieth, within twelve months from the execution thereof; and that all deeds so done and executed shall be valid and pass estates in land, or right to other estate, without livery of seisin, attournment, or other ceremony whatsoever.” It will be argued by Mr. Whiteside, that as the Legislature, in the Act of 1715, required the deed previous to registration to be proved by evidences, it is not necessary to resort to the subscribing witnesses in those cases where proof of handwriting would be sufficient at common law. What would have been the construction of that Act, upon a deed offered to be proved in one year after the execution (which is not the case here) and before any other statute had passed on the subject, it will not now be necessary to inquire, as we expect to show that from a uniform train of legislative declarations, it has been always required that the deed should either be acknowledged by the grantor, his agent or attorney, or proved by the subscribing witnesses. The next law which passed upon this subject -was enacted in 17 60, and expressly provides that before the deed can be admitted to registration it shall be acknowledged by the grantor, his agent or attorney, or proved by the oath of the subscribing witnesses; and gives two years’ time for registration. In the Act of 1766 will be found a provision in the same words; so also in the Act of 1773, 1777, 1782 and 1784, and in every other law which has passed on the subject, except the law of 1811, which can be of no service to the plaintiffs, as the probate now objected to was made several years before. As a further evidence of the legislative meaning upon this point, if anything is required more than an express declaration, we will refer the Court ■to an Act passed in 1787, providing that the deeds from the office of Lord Grenville might he proved by parity of hands. Now, if this was understood to be the law before in relation to all deeds, it was, to say the least of it, extremely absurd to say it should apply to a particular kind of deeds ; for it would have applied to them without any such law. It is, therefore, a fair mode of argument, to say that, when the Legislature recognized proof of a certain description as being sufficient to establish the execution of a particular kind of deeds, they meant thereby to exclude the idea of that proof being sufficient to prove the execution of other deeds. As a further illustration of the uniform view which the Legislature have taken of this point, we will refer the Court to two statutes, — the one enacted by North Carolina in 1756 (ch. 6, § 4, Hay. Rev. 66), and the other by the Legislature of Tennessee, in the year 1806 (ch. 49-, § 1, Hay. Rev. 413). Each of these statutes was intended to remedy a particular inconvenience. The grantee had no summary method of compelling the attendance of witnesses to a deed, for the purpose of proving the execution, preparatory to registration. This was an evil which the Legislature felt anxious to cure; and therefore they passed these statutes, respectively, authorizing the grantee to apply to ’ the court of the county where land might lie, and procure a summons for the subscribing witnesses, compelling them to attend, and testify what they knew about the execution of the deed. The evil was that the grantee had no summary way of compelling the proof of the execution of his deed (perhaps the only previous mode was by a bill to perpetuate testimony). The Legislature, to remedy this inconvenience, passed' the laws in question, authorizing a process to compel the attendance of the subscribing witnesses. If it had been the law that the execution of the deed could be proved by witnesses, other than those who were subscribed as such, this remedy would be but half complete. In truth, it was never believed by the Legislature that the deed could be proved by any but the subscribing witnesses; and therefore, when they make a remedial provision on that subject, they only speak of witnesses of that legal character. The only other statute which we shall notice was passed in 1811, subsequent to the respective probates. It provides that where the witnesses are dead, or live out of the State, and the grantor is also dead, that the deed may be registered by proving the handwriting of the witnesses and grantor ; and that wh'en it is so proved and registered it shall be read in evidence. The plaintiffs do not pretend that they come within the provision of this Act, nor can they do so, because their probate and registration is long prior to the passage of the law, and because the law is only prospective, and is to continue in force for two years thereafter. It seems most manifest that no such privilege existed previous to the enactment of this statute, and that the object of the Legislature was to provide a new remedy, which was to be tried for a limited time. But admitting that a deed for land may he proved as an instrument at common law, so as to pass the legal estate to the grantee, and still we must prevail. The evidence offered is ex parte. In those cases, at common law, where proof of the execution was admitted by persons other than' the subscribing witness, it was in open court, and not by an ex parte examination. As to the third objection, viz. proof of execution, upon trial, we will briefly state what we conceive to be the law. When this testimony is offered, it is upon the principle, that there has been no registration. We contend that until registration no estate passes. The Act of 1715 is the only law of this country which authorizes lands to pass by deed. It is, in substance, a copy of the statute 27 Henry 8, in relation to deeds of bargain and sale. The English statute requires that the deed shall be enrolled; and our statute requires that it should be registered; and these things must be respectively done, before any estate passes. It may be that when registered it relates back to the time of execution; but still until it is registered the legal estate is not in the grantee. It has constantly been determined in England that no estate passes until after enrolment; 1 Bac. Abr. 277, 278; Cro. Ja. 52; 4 Co. Hinds Case; 2 Com. Dig. 65, 66. Upon this point we know of no determination in this country. .A case occurred in North Carolina, in which the Court said, that when the deed was enrolled, it passed the estate ah initio, and would so operate as to consider the grantee as legally seised from the execution. 2 Hay. Rep. 287, 288. Such a determination could alone be founded upon the idea that no estate passed without registration. Indeed, the act of Assembly expressly requires it preparatory to the passing a legal estate; and it is not for the Court' to say it may be passed in any other way. In truth, it will not do for the gentleman to say that the act is to be disregarded, for it is the very foundation of his claim; it has no effect whatever without it. In those cases where an instrument has been supported by discarding a statute made upon the subject, the courts have done so upon the ground that the instrument is good at common law. There is no pretence for such a thing in this case. There never was a case where a right accrued under a statute that such right was adjudged valid if the express requisitions of the statute had not been complied with. Those requisitions have not been complied with in this case; the deed has not been registered;. and therefore we humbly hope that it will be rejected. The reporter cannot but regret that he was unable, from indisposition, to attend to the whole of the argument of Mr. Whiteside., for the plaintiffs. He will not, therefore, do Mr. Whiteside the injustice of attempting to give it to the public in a garbled state. \n",

      "judges:   parties:  Darby’s Lessee v. Mayer and another. opinions:  Mr. Justice Johnson delivered the opinion of the Court. This was an action of ejectment, in which the present plaintiff was plaintiff in the Court below. His title is derived through a patent to onevJphn Rice, and successive convevances down to him-¿elf, which it is immaterial to recapitulate, since no question arises upon’this part of the evidence. The defence set up was the statute of limitations, and in order to bring himself within its provisions, the defendant received the patent under which the plaintiff claims, as the patent for his own land, and undertakes to connect himself with it. This gave rise to a variety of exceptions táken by the plaintiff to the evidence offered by the defendant for this purpose, to which the defendant repliés, that should he have failed in establishing a connexion by a chain of title, he has complied with the statute notwithstanding, by proving his possession within the patent issued to Rice, which, he contends, is all the connexion with a patent which the law requires. One of the grounds of exception made by the plaintiff is, that the evidence of the defendant proves his possession to be upon a tract of land essentially different from that which the patent covers. And not a little difficulty has existed on this pait of the case, to understand the counsel when discussing the question pf. identity. All this has arisen, from emitting to have the locus in quo established by a survey; an omission to which the Court takes this opportunity to express its disapprobation. It is true,, that the case upon this bill of exceptions can be disposed of without such a survey, but great facility would- have been afforded by a survey, in understanding -the discussion, which, without it, was scarcely intelligible. It is very obvious, when we refer to the patent, to Rice under which the plaintiff claims; and the entry to Ramsay through which the defendant deduces title, both of which aré made parts of the bill of exceptions, that they do not’ describe the same land. On the contrary, that to Rice, calling for the entry to Ramsay as its eastern boundary, must necessarily lie without it. However, we are of opinion, thát we are not now at liberty to notice this inconsistency. The bill of exceptions states, that the plaintiff proved the defendant in possession of the land granted to Rice, and the defendant proved himself in possession of the land entered to Ramsay, both concurring in the fact that the land in the defendant’s possession was the land in controversy; from which it certainly results that Rice held a patent for Ramsay’s entry. But the defendant having no pátent, the other has, of course, the legal estate in him, which may be barred by the defendant’s possession, if he brings himself within the provisions of the statute. In order to connect himself with the .patent, the defendant , proved a sale, of the inchoate interest of John Rice to one Solomon Kitts, and the next link in his title depended upon the will of Solomon Kitts. To prove that Kitts devised the land to the trustees, through whom defendant made title, a copy and probate of the will of Kitts was produced in evidence, duly certified from the Orphan’s Court of Baltimore cóunty, Maryland, in which, it seems, the will had been recently proved and recorded. This evidence was excepted to, but the Court overruled the.exception;,and it went to the jury. . Effect of the probate of «ni ■*\"••• The question is, whether the evidence thus offered was legal evidence of a devise of land ? , The common law doctrine on this subject no contests; the ordinary’s.probate was no evidence of the execution of the will in ejectment. Where the will itself was in existence, and could landsproduced, it was necessary to; produce it; when the will was lost, or could not be. procured to be produced, in evidence, secondary evidence was necessarily resorted to, according to the nature of the case. But .whatever'proof was made,' was required to be made before the Cpurt that tried the cause; the proof before the ordinary being ex parte, and the heir at law having had no opportunity to cross-examine the witnesses ; neither were the same solemnities required to admit the will to probate, as were indispensable to give it validity as a devise of real estate. At first it'was a question of controversy between the common law and ecclesiastical. Courts, whether a will, containing a devise of lands, should hot be precluded from probate, although containing a bequest of personalty also. And the question was one of serious import, since the : common law Courts required the production of the original, whereas the consequence of probate was, that the original , should he. consigned to the archives of the Court that proved it. This was at length. compromised, and the practice introduced of delivering out the will, when necessary, upon seeürity to return it.- Upon general principles, there is no question, that, lands in Tennessee must, in all respects, be subject to the land laws of Tennessee. Their laws- affecting devises, and the rules of. their Courts respecting evidence, in ejectment, must be the law of this case, as far as the constitution of the United States does not control the one or the other. The lex loci rœi silœ governs as to the effect of a devise in one country of lands in another. Quœre, how far this general principle is modified by the provisions of the constitution and laws of the U. S. in respect to the faith and credit, &c. to be given to the public acts, records, and judicial proceedings of each State in every other State? With regard to the modification under which the right of devising may be exercised, there is no question that the power of the State is unlimited ; and wills of realty, wherever executed, must conform to the laws of Tennessee. The right of determining whether its láws have been complied with in this respect, is a necessary result from the power of passing those laws. But in this respect, it has been supposed,, that the right of the States is m some measure controlled by that article of the constitution, which declares “ that full faith and credit shall be given in State to the public acts, records, and judicial proceedings of every other State.” And hence that a will of lands duly recorded in one States so as to be evidence in the Courts of. that State, is rendered evidence thereby in the Court of every other State, provided the record, on the face of it, shows that it possessed the solemnities required by the laws of the State where the land lies. As this is a. question of some delicacy as it relates to devises of lands, the Court passes it over at present, being induced to adopt the opinion, that the rule, could not be applied to this case, since the laws of Maryland do not make the probate here offered evidence in a land-cause in the Courts of that State, law ^of laud, as to ev¡probate, of a an action oi the same with law of England‘ That the law of Maryland, with regard to the evidence of a devise in ejectment, is the common law of England, is clearly recognised in the case of Smith's lessee v. Steele, (1 Harris and M'Henry, 419.) In that case, as in this, a copy of the will and. probate were offered in evidence, and was supported by proof of the loss of the original will from the office of probates. Yet the whole argument turns, not on the admission of the copy and probate per se, but whether admissible at all to prove tbe existence and contents of the original will. And the Court declare, in permitting it to be read in evidence to the jury, that they are at liberty Jo find for or against the original will, not holding them bound from the production of the probate to find for the plaintiffs. It is observable also in that case, that it is yielded in argument throughout, that the admission of the probate could only be sustained on the idea, that the acts of 1704 and 1715, now no more in force, permitted the ordinary to take probate of wills of laud. But it has been supposed, that the Maryland law of probates of 1798, has, by express enactment, made such probates evidence in their own Courts. And had it been shown, that such had been the established construction of that law, and thé practice of the.State Courts under it, this Court would not have hesitated to relinquish their. own views on the correct construction to be given to that clause. As it is, we must pursue the suggestions of our own minds with regard to the legal construction of the act.. The act of Assembly of Maryland of 1798. s. 4 ch. 2. srt. 3. does not extend to a will of lands so as to make the probate conclusive evidence in an action of ejectment. The clause alluded to is the 4th sec. ch. 2. art. 3. of the act in question, and is in these words: “ An, attested copy, under the seal of office, of any will, testament, or codicil, recorded in any office authorized to record the-same, shall be admitted in evidence in any Court of law or equity, provided that the execution of the original wilt or codicil be subject to be contested until a, probate hath been had according to this act.’’ It is true, that the generality of the terms in the first lines of this clause is. such as would, if unrestricted by the context, embrace wills Of lands. It is also true, that the previous chapter, in the same article prescribes, the formalities necessary to give validity, to devises of real estate ; it is further true, that the previous sections of the second chapter indicate the means, and impose the duty of delivering up wills of all descriptions to the' Register of the Court of Probates, for safe keeping, after the death of the testator, and until they shall be demanded by some person authorized to demand them for the purpose of proving them. But it is equally true, that the act does not authorize the registering of any will without probate. Nor does it, in any one of its provisions, relate to the probate of any wills, except wills of goods and chattels. The clause recited makes evidénce of such, wills only as are recorded in the offices of Courts, authorized to record them. But when the powér of taking probate is expressly limited to the probate of wills of goods and chattels, we see not with what propriety the, meaning of the clause in question can be extended to wills of arty other description. The Orphan’s Court may take probates of wills though they affect lands, provided they'also affect goods and chattels ; but the will, nevertheless, is conclusively established only as to the personalty. By the laws of Tennessee, the probate of a will of lands in another State is not made evidence in an ejectment for lands in Tennessee. Unless the words be explicit and imperative to the contrary, the construction must-necessarily conform to the existing laws of the State on the -subject of wills Of real estate. And when the power of taking probates is confined to wills of personalty, wé think the construction of the clause recited must be limited by the context. We are, therefore, of opinion, that there was in the law of Maryland which could, under the constitution, make the document offered prove this will per se evidence in a; land cause, Nor does there appear to exist any rule, of law in Tennessee, which could make such a document-good evidence under the laws of that State. Since, therefore, the charge of the Court was general in favour of the defendants, and the effect of each particular piece of evidence upon the minds of ;he jury cannot be discriminated, this opinion disposes of the whole cause. The case presents séveral other and very important questions, but the Court will at present decline remarking on them.

The local law. of Maryland, as to the effect of evidence of the probate of a will of lands, in an action of ejectment, is the same with the common law. A-duly certified copy of a will of; lands, and the probate thereof, in the Orphan’s Court.of Maryland, is not evidence in an action of ejectment, of a devise of lands in Tennessee. ERROR to the Circuit Court of West Tennessee. This cause was argued by Mr. Bibb and Mr. Isaacs for the plaintiff in error, and by Mr. White and Mr. D. Hoffman for the defendants in error. But as the judgment turned only on a single point, and does not finally dispose of the cause, it has not been thought necessary to report the argument. \n"
